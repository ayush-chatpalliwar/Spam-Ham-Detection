"Dear Friend,Greetings to you.I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.",1
"MR. CHEUNG PUIHANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG. Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinionBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my private box, {che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr Cheung Pui.___________________________________________________________________________Mail envoyï¿½ par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke- http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com",1

Madame Secretary:Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and RicardoLagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point it appears wehave a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C. stop in Miami to pick up RicardoLagos and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubtabout our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates itsAmerica's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday Representative Connie Mack didthe same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough stalwart guy. Heand his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.Finally we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identifyfurther opportunities for your engagement.I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key momentsand take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented adebilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of ourefforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us and for that we are grateful to you.RegardsTom,0

HiAttached is a new draft in which I have tried to pack in the changes/additions you requested yesterday (as wellas Cheryl's and Lissa's suggested edits).To use a metaphor (or rather simile) of the season we are at the stage where it's a bit like decorating aChristmas tree: trying to hang the ornaments so no branch bends too much and so the whole tree stays upright.I wanted to get it to you first but will circulate to the others now and can send to Oscar if that's helpful in termsof getting you a hard copy.Dan,0

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an director and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Seven Million, One Hundred Thousand united states dollars (US$27,100,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf into a reliable company/individual account depending on your convenience.More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance the whole transaction. This amount (US$27.1m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$27.1 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured tel/fax number whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matterbecause we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.",1

"FROM:MR. MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM.BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,BANK OF AFRICA(B.O.A),DAKAR, SENEGAL.Dear friend,I know that this letter may come to you as a suprise. I got your contact address from the Internet when I was searching for a business partner.My name is MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM. I am the Bill and Exchange Manager of bank of africa(B.O.A) ,Dakar Senegal.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of USD$22.3 Million (TWEN TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his wife  and children in a plane crash in  year 2001 plane crash happened in Cote d'Ivoire.(Kenya Air Ways)Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I  decided to make this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it because I don't want the money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after  five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a Senegalaise cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I have agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me, after which I shall visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as i arranged,you will furnished me with a good receving account detail where the money will be transfered, your private tel and fax number for easy communication.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance director,for easy execution of the transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for the transfer.Please I would like you  keep this transaction confidential and as a top secret as you may wish to know that I am a Bank official.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours Sincerely,MR.

(Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).Back in the US the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the WashingtonPost's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that ""there were zero building starts in the WestBank settlements.""During the week of June 21 I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to documentnew settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at HarHoma a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoingconstruction of hundreds of new settlement units â€” documents of the settlement freeze sHam.0Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after heannounced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a falsedistinction between the West Bank and ""parts of Jerusalem"" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeligovernment flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009 ""We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank andJerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such."" With a few exceptions Obama allowed this scheme to goforward.According to the Washington Post Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuringJewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported""The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues including the expiration of amoratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September."" This may mean an end to the settlement freeze but it wasonly an illusion after all.",0

"STRICTLY PERSONALMy name is MRS JULLIET ABRAMS. I am the credit manager in a bank here in the Republic of Benin. I am contacting you with regard to transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that atransaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.PROPOSITION;I am the account officer of a foreigner who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.htmlSince his death, none of his next-of-kins has come forward to put claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accidenthimself and his wife(May their soul rest in peace). Though, the bank has made several publications to locate the family members, but all was not successful. We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds (US$35,000,000.00) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after five years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account as unclaimed bills andthe money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it was as a result of this,we conceived the idea of searching for a foreigner who can apply as the next of kin/beneficiary. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate division an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Pleaseacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following informations, if you are interested.1.A Beneficiary name? In order for me to prepare the document for transfer of the funds in your name.2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and mutual trust in each other. We shall be compensating you with 25% on final conclusion of this project, we have set aside 5% for expenses and 70% shall be for my colleagues and I.I intend to retire after the conclusion of thistransaction. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endevour to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowedon you,I await your urgent mail to my personal Email:julliet06@3xl.netRegards,",1

On July 8, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor withthe South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. PhillipMorris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelvecalendar months, valued at (Twenty-eight Million ThreeHundred Thousand American Dollars only) in my branch.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to hisforwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we senta reminder and finally we discovered from his contractemployers, that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an auto-mobileaccident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died withoutmaking a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin wasfruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered thatMr.Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations inall his official documents,including his Bank Depositpaperwork in my Bank.This sum of $28,300,000.00 is stillsitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled overwith the principal sum at the end of each year.

"19floor Eugene Marais Avenue, Constantia, South AfricaDear I sincerely ask for forgiveness for I know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of communication. This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. I am Mr.Anuka Ifufeh, the Auditor General of NED BANK PLC here South Africa, during the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank 1995 and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account is Mr. Franklin Sullivan, a foreigner, a miner and an industrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died misteriously .Since 1998 no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it. My investigation proved to me that the account has no other beneficiary and that Mr. Franklin Sullivan until his death was the manager Sullivan Coy.(pty). SA. We will start the first transfer with Thirty six million dollars [$36,000,000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.The amount involved is (USD $136M) Thirty Six Million United States Dollars only. I want to first transfer $36,000.000 [Thirty Six Million United States Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner.I am revealing this to you with believing God that you will never let me down in this business. Also send your private telephone number and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this business proposition. With my influence and the position of a bank official whom is working in our favour we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.

"proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you,delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me.

Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through the email account that i will provide therein in this email. Further more be informed that the fact that you are a foreigner gives you the privilege to stand in as my deceased client beneficiary as my deceased client had no relation all his family died with him during the war and I can not use my relations because its not accepted here in Hong Kong. Also I am very confident that we will be able to establish the trust that is needed to complete this deal and all that I need from the time been is your willingness and commitment so that we can end this in the next two weeks.

This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon. Should you be interested I will prefer you to reach me via email. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.I await your response.Mr.Cheungmailcheung001@yahoo.com",1

"Good Day Dear Friend,My name is Mr. Femi Gidado, manager, credit and oreign bills of CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (C.B.N). I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account mber14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole assengers aboard on August 6, 1997.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of $20 m, [twenty million united states dollars]which has been with my branch for a very long time.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name hall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay In view of this I got your contact while searching through the internet after realizing that your name and country is similar to the deceased.I will give you 40% of the total sum. Upon the receipt of your sponse, I will send you by e-mail the application and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized with in five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a elation to the deceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your decision including your private or mobile Telephone numbers for quick communication.Respectfully submitted,BEST REGARDSMr. Femi Gidado",1

After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contac=t you among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I belie=ve that God has a way of helping who is in need.I am (MUSTAFA BRUNU  Esq),the Head of file Department in BANK OF AFRICA (BO=A). In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A d=ollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one= of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21,= 2003) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have =been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we =cannot =B5 release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or rela=tive on to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines,But unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation d=ied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the cla=im. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my depar=tment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the mo=ney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and su=bsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t want thi=s money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained u=nclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasu=ry as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this busin=ess is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,and a Burki=nabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this= money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a =foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the bus=iness and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will v=isit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund  as arranged, you m=ust apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased ind=icating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone an=d fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the mo=ney will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax =or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notic=e that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any= atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me on my number +226-76 54 93 42. immediately as soon as= you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.Your=92s fa=ithfully,MUSTAFA BRUNU  (Esq.)FROM (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.GOD BLESSINGS,PROTECTIONS AND GUIDIAN=CE TO YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as= to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will pr=ove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so =that we discuss very well over this business._________________________________________________________________Play free games, earn tickets, get cool prizes!

"Pis read the following. I've followed this caseTorture on homefront cries out for justiceComments <http://www.suntimes.comews/marin/1734591CST-EDT-caro126.article>August 26 2009BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times ColumnistThe feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteninglycloser.And the irony screams out.Carol MannOn Monday the same day Eric Holder President Obama's attorney general announced he would appoint a specialcounsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects a U.S. appealscourt at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country wherehe was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months shocked with electrodes hung by his arms and sexually violated.A Turkish Kurd Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey beforeit re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as ""terrorist"" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew.Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department'sImmigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working tax-paying CHamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistana small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert Mich. tlie feds now saw an international menace.In 2004 the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.If it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney a former FBI anti-terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin a liberal Democrat and Rep. FredUpton a conservative Republican Parlak would still be in jail.Thanks to them this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely.The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holderlaunched his torture inquiry.B5The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons andJudge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose hisrelationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.Let's remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is theattorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees John Ashcroftand Alberto Gonzales.The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court ofAppeals one of the nation's most brilliant judges. By September of 2005 Posner noted ""a staggering 40 percent of the136 petitions"" had been reversed due to according to one ruling a willingness to ignore ""the most basic of facts.""Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin a Carter appointee writes withboth clarity and conviction arguing the government's ""awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of ourcountry.""Like a surgeon Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his owncolleagues and ends by saying ""I remain hopeful nevertheless that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoidoverzealous error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by thewayside. It is just a sHame that even if my hope proves true it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak.""Parlak's legal team will appeal.Meanwhile Holder like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him is the new boss of the immigration courts.As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad here's hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture ofIbrahim Parlak.",0

"See hus analysis of where we are on EAS but also on the US Japan and Chinese urbanization and trade patterns..Nothing that new but valuable coming from him.The Australian - 19 Jun 10Embracing everyone from the US to India Greg Sheridan Foreign editorGEORGE Yeo Singapore's Foreign Minister is one of the most dazzlingly clever people you could meet in SoutheastAsia. Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore'scharacteristic hard-headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context as well as a lively human sympathyfor the diversity of the region that surrounds him which I at any event find almost unique. I remember interviewinghim at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia asthe growing centre of the global economy as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were thensuggesting. ""No it doesn't"" Yeo told me. ""At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years."" It moved thegraph a little to the right it didn't change the trends. On that Yeo was absolutely right.But it is also Yeo's ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable.This week Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historicaltour de force conversations in which he specialises.It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd's proposal to establish an Asia-PacificCommunity. The Prime Minister wanted the US India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal withstrategic issues as well as trade and economics. Singapore's hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thoughtthat the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of which it is a key member could be sidelined. I asked Yeo whether theregion was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish. ""We still need a lot more discussion"" he said.""The vision is going to change dramatically with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. Theconfiguration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred. But that's the reality we've got to workwith.We need a regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses. The single most important relationship isbetween the US and China. Increasingly the relationship between India and China is becoming more important. I thinkeventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangleconsisting of the US China and India.""Yeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being inharmony on the evolution of regional organisations. This is how he saw it having played out: ""When Prime Minister Ruddproposed the APC Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round the region. He did not visit all countries. He made it quiteplain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved. We talked among ourselves and quite soon theconclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined. So there was an immediate blowback from the region.""To PM Rudd's credit he quickly clarified this that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was hisvision from the very beginning. I said 'All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that'.""Separately we had (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating his view of an East Asian regionapparently centred on China Japan and Korea. It created as you would expect a natural reaction in Southeast Asia. Thatgot us all thinking in the region. How to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way that's comfortable. For a long timewe've been thinking about China more recently about India."" Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations alsoevolved slowly in particular the East Asia Summit which includes Australia and New Zealand as well as ASEAN ChinaJapan South Korea and India. He said: ""It took us a long time to create the EAS structure. Some preferred it to be basedon the ASEAN plus three (China Japan Korea) harking back to (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir(MoHamad)'s East Asian caucus. ""Others felt that's too limiting. If it's just ASEAN plus three that may be a little lop-sidedbecause of the economic weight of the plus three. So we thought if we have India on one side and Australia and NewZealand to the south there's a certain natural equipoise.""Then it took many discussions. The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed. Russia is tooimportant a country. There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not accommodate them in the EAS atthat time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS mightexclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing becauseAustralia and New Zealand were in it. In any case countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive.What would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs.""So where do we end up today? ""When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. Sonow there are two possibilities either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (includingthe US and Russia) configuration. In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd. I think in the endhe's happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn't want to interfere in our regional discussion.""So you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd. Whatever evolves nobody is going to call it theAsia-Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder as everyone accepts that Bob Hawkefounded APEC in 1989. On the other hand it does seem as though it's very much more than likely that there will finallybe a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India which is able to discuss security. That is prettymuch Rudd's policy aim and as Yeo constructively puts it Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends of Rudd candescribe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative. His enemies can say the APC came to nothingand was a failure in Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light. There is only space to give thesmallest sampling of Yeo's prodigiously rich insights on other issues.On the US he said: ""Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for manydecades. It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas always on the boil. It has a sunny disposition. We inSingapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties.""On China I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power financial and military soit could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody. Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijing'spreoccupations were internal and said: ""China is the No 1 trading partner for Japan Korea Taiwan Hong Kong Indiaand already No 2 for New Zealand and for all the countries (in Asia) the graph points in the same direction.""(The historical process) is high drama in China. It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoismdeveloped as a different ideology from Bolshevism. China was 20 per cent urban. It's now 40 per cent urban and will goto 80 per cent or 90 per cent. The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison but look at Dickens or Victor Hugo.Look at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation. In China it's all compressed. If they succeedthey will be the greatest nation on Earth. The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks. The skills which brought themto power won't keep them in power.""He recalled that early in China's economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore as a mostlyChinese nation ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner combining rapid economic growth with socialorder and a respect for tradition. Then that interest seemed to wane. But now Chinese delegations are back again inlarge numbers fascinated particularly with how Singapore manages the politics of being a big and boomingcity. Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians' electoral clinics in Singapore observing how real problems arerecognised integrated into the system and dealt with.I asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past 60 years. Hereplied: ""Their politics now are a mess. Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely reconfiguring the pieces is-difficult. A lot of Japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart.""The DP1 came to power determined to pull the pieces apart the Liberal Democratic Party from big business from thebureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes a long time for them to change but when they do change they do it with afury and intensity that surprises everyone."" Japan has gone through profound periods of change in the past - the MeijiRestoration of the 19th century in which it decided to become a modern nation; or the pervasive change after WorldWar II in which it decided to embrace democracy and the role of the key US ally in the region. The fact that it is nowgrappling with change is no reason to think it cannot emerge again with a successful model.Yeo is an old old friend of Australia and in a sense a long-term cHampion of Australia's involvement in Southeast Asia.He has been a minister in the Singapore government for more than 20 years. He embodies a great deal of institutionalmemory and strategic continuity not just within Singapore but within the broader councils of the region.It's just a pity he doesn't visit us a bit more often.",0

"sbwhoeopSaturday February 13 2010 10:36 AMRe: also...Clemons posted this piece on his dinner with Petraeus (it's replete with a lot of punditry) but he told me more detail abouthis attitude and interest. Among other things Petraeus recounted a joke about Gates' speech at the Alfalfa Club dinnerthat Petraeus couldn't be there because he was in Iowa. Petraeus didn't tell that story to disdain the possibility. He smiledand watched closely for reaction from others. SFebruary 13 2010Steve CemonsPublisher of ""The Washington Note""../T1 â€¢ ""Pt r:1:Â°' tâ€ž â€¢. N (1 :(1 Jr) F*az.-.1--anracsounga.awarnrmacta=ava-_rmuacartatmott--=-0....-rmaamaxatiAmasm...u.cnromar...........r.nocura--uarni.m.rarcnt.r.trnmar.rarti:4.3resecono....riatvars:I recently had the opportunity to participate in a small dinner with CENTCOM Commander .General David Petraeus and his wife Holly. These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact thatthey happened is not off limits.Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked tohim that if I Twilt.--srgc that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I'd seen him out ofuniform an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.In August of 2007 I wroteoiece stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus mightrun for President in 2012. In April 2008 Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled ""TheGeneral"" referencing my earlier take.Recently legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for thecounterinsurgency guru in his piece ""President ?etraeus7""Petraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazine's tip 100 ttzal thinkers and as U.S. News & WorldReports ""Washington Whispers"" notes he is going to be speaking in May 2010 at the annual American EnterpriseInstitute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award.In January 2010 Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card raceagainst Petraeus the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public justdidn't know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and hisnumbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama trailing 44-34. But at +13his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem forhim is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don't know enough about him tohave formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics butif he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time.President Obama himself according to what some of his aides have reported to me is quite taken with David Petraeusand respects his approach and thinking.Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might reactto a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked Petraeus offered a cryptic rather thanclear response. (see above video)At the ""First Draft of History"" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group the Newseum and theAspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic reviewon Afghanistan responded that he ""would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could.""Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr.j. ""We will salute and execute [thePresident's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability.""But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years there is no way thatthis intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Partytakeover of the Republican political machine.There is always the possibility that a core of reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg James Baker OlympiaSnowe Chuck Hegel Alan Simpson John Whitehead Peter Peterson Rita Hauser and others will try to rekindle classicRepublican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead.Remember that Eisenhower clinched the Republican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knewwar would end the Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today couldbe the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so.But there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus runningfor President -- and that is his running for Vice President.I think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White House Bidenhas done the best job of outperforming expectations. He had given President Obama much needed counsel not alwaystaken regrettably but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting. Biden has been the keyagent behind the scenes in moving Iraq's elections forward. He has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in thenuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship withRussia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge in my view remain compelling.But Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it.As I look at it now Hillary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State wouldbe a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. Her franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet butmoving Hillary closer to the White House (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundredfeet closer to the White House than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna's takeover of all thekey political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daley's machine Deschle's machine Kennedy's machineEdwards' machine and then the Clintons'.But General David Petraeus in his business suit lurks out there. Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he isweak on national security. The Republicans -- at Cheney's constant goading (and now Sarah Palin's) -- seem to want tocontinue to play politics through fear-mongering.Obama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a Republican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting theGeneral on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat.Crazy? Perhaps.But inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointingRepublican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman Jr.to serve as US Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.And get this we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesn't care to vote --but reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open.This is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry.My hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else Petraeus will be on the shortlist of those considered.-- Steve Clemons publishes the popular political blog The Washington Note.",0

I will be in contact with my office assoon as I land and can always cut the trip short if necessary although under the circumstances I think it is important tokeep to our schedules.As we have discussed one of the main drivers of our PD strategy is to ensure we have strong relations in all sectors tohelp us weather the invitable storms in our relationships and at this point it looks like we have a hurricane on thehorizon.Take care and look forward to seeing you when we both get back.Jm,0

The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the =property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given =to me.I am convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his =next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me. =By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware =of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my =country.I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to =present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary =of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, =hence I contacted you.

"#45 Rue Grand Yorf,DAKAR, SENEGAL.Assalamaulakum.My Dear Friend,Compliments of the day.I did like to send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter. After due deliberation with my son,I decided to forward to you this business proposal, we want you to assist us .I will give you more information. As to this regard as soon as you reply.I am Mrs.Estelle Mamadou . I am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of 7.3 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes.I therefore personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to move this money in to your country where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the Senegal Government.This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband and a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands share .Presently, the Government has intensified their probe in to my husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and the arrest of my First son.In view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of our finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the money in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we have such funds.Further more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder and corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after the president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he is still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital documents.Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my family,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to invest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son MoHammade to come over to your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.Please kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal telephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of the total sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during thecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you until we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Senegal Government.I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.Your URGENT response is needed.Regards and God Bless you.Mrs.Estelle Mamadou ._________________________________________________________________Dï¿½couvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! www.windowslivemessenger.fr",1

"MANCHESTER (WA) 20515  Greetings,  As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry forme, because I believe everyone will die someday.  Myname is Mr.CAMPBELL WILLIAM, from NEW ZEALAND, I havebeen diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which wasdiscovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying formy health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, andright now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts.  I have since lost my power of speech and can onlymanage to write now, as that has been the only way Iam able to communicate. I have not particularly livedmy life so well, as I never really cared for anyonenot even myself but my business. Though I am veryrich, I was never generous, I was always hostile topeople and only focus on my business as that is theonly thing I cared for  But now I regret all this as I now know that there ismore to life than just wanting to have or make all themoney in the world. I believe when God gives me asecond chance to come to this world I would live mylife a different way from how I have lived it. Nowthat I know my time is near, I have willed and givenmost of my properties and assets to my immediate andextended family members and as well as a few closefriends.  I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul andso, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I did on earth. So far, I have distributedmoney to some charity organizations in UK, Brazil andIreland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this my self any more. I once askedmembers of my family to close one of my accounts anddonate the money, which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and South Africa, theyrefused and kept the money to themselves.  Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem notto be contented with what I have left for them. Thelast of my money which only few of them knows of isthe huge cash deposit that I have with my Bank inABIDJAN. I will want you to help me collect thisdeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.waiting for reply.

Firstly, you&nbsp; both have the same last name, which makes the claim most credible, Secondly I strongly believe that the Security Company does not deserve to inherit the&nbsp; funds, These reasons led to my resolve to claim the funds.</DIV>  <DIV><BR>That was why I&nbsp; contacted you,With your permission, I will proceed to establish you as the next of kin/Beneficiary to my late client.

"Below is McC's statement and some early articles:McC Statement:I extend my sincerest apology for this profile. It was a mistakereflecting poor judgment and should never have happened.Throughout my career I have lived by the principles of personal honorand professional integrity. What is reflected in this article falls farshort of that standard.I have enormous respect and admiration for President Obama and hisnational security team and for the civilian leaders and troops fightingthis war and I remain committed to ensuring its successful outcome.Aides to U.S. general in Afghanistan slam Obama:report20 mins agoWASHINGTON (Reuters) â€” Aides to the top U.S. general in Afghanistan insulted some of President Barack Obama's closest adviserscalling one a ""clown"" and another a ""wounded animal"" in an article to be published Friday in Rolling Stone magazine.The article also quotes an aide describing the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal's""disappointment"" with his initial one-on-one meeting with Obama last year.Quoting all the McChrystal aides anonymously the article portrays a split between the U.S. military and Obama's advisers at anextremely sensitive moment for the Pentagon which is fending off criticism of its strategy to turn around the nearly nine-year-oldAfghan war.The Pentagon had no immediate comment about the article which has been brought to the attention of senior officials.It quotes a member of McChrystal's team making jokes about Vice President Joe Biden who was seen as critical of the general'sefforts to escalate the conflict and who had favored a more limited counter-terrorism approach.""Biden?"" the aide was quoted as saying. ""Did you say: Bite me?""Another aide called White House National Security Adviser Jim Jones a retired four star general a ""clown"" who was ""stuck in 1985.""It quoted an adviser to McChrystal dismissing an early meeting with Obama as a ""10-minute photo op.""""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him who he was. The boss was pretty disappointed"" the adviser told the magazine.McChrystal a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day was brought into Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessorwas pushed out.The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration with the exception of Secretary of State Hillary Clintonwho backed McCrystal's request for additional troops in Afghanistan.Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Richard Holbrooke Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.""The boss says he's like a wounded animal"" a member of the general's team is quoted as saying. ""Holbrooke keeps hearing rumorsthat he's going to get fired so that makes him dangerous.""McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak of a classified cable from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan KarlEikenberry last year. The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking incredibility.""I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before"" McChrystal was quoted as saying in thearticle.""Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail they can say 'I told you so.""(Editing by Washington World Desk)Copyright Â© 2010 Yahoo! Inc. All rights reserved.And from the WSJ:0 JUNE 21 2010 6:55 PM ETMcChrystal's Next Offensive?Relations between the U.S. military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last year's three-month review of Afghan war strategy a state of affairsunlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal the overall commander in Afghanistan that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on Friday.In the eight-page article released to reporters on Monday ahead of publication McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry the U.S.ambassador to Kabul of undermining his war plan within the administration.Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall â€” fewer troops more drone attacks â€” the article reports thatMcChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. ""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal reportedly jokes. ""Who'sthat?""Later in the article McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increaseadvocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai â€” views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff.""I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before"" McChrystal is quoted as saying. ""Here's one that covers his flank for the historybooks. Now if we fail they can say 'I told you so.""The article titled ""The Runaway General"" has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a topcommander in hot water: an August 2008 cover story in Esquire <hop://wvav.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon > on Adm. William ""Fox"" Fallon then commander of all U.S.forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago.In that Esquire piece however Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no suchallegation but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players.Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration including National SecurityAdviser James Jones and other leading politicians like Sens. John Kerry (D. Mass.) and John McCain (R. Ariz). They also make some unflattering references toPresidentBarack Obama himself saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year.Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystalaides.A spokesman for McChrystal did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday.Copyright 2008 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who's that?'"" the article quotes him as saying.""Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite Me?""McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt ""betrayed"" by the US ambassador to Kabul Karl Eikenberry in a White House debate over war strategy last year.Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal's request for more troops the commander suggested the ambassador hadtried to protect himself for history's sake.""I like Karl I've known him for years but they'd never said anything like that to us before"" McChrystal tells the magazine.""Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail they can say ?I told you so.""Eikenberry himself a former commander in Afghanisan had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partnerand that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire.The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal's request for tens ofthousands of reinforcements.Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for the strategy review was a difficult time the general tells the magazine.""I found that time painful"" McChrystal says. ""I was selling an unsellable position.""An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago just after thepresident named him to take over in Afghanistan.""It was a 10-minute photo op"" the general's adviser says.""Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him who he was.. he didn?t seem very engaged.""The boss was pretty disappointed"" says the adviser.The profile titled ""The Runaway General"" portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal while arguing the general has seized control overthe war on the military and diplomatic fronts.The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region Richard Holbrooke and complains about a dinner with an unnamed Frenchminister during a visit to Paris.""Oh not another e-mail from Holbrooke"" McChrystal says looking at his messages on a mobile phone. ""I don't even want to open it.""In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official McChrystal says: ""How'd I get screwed into going to this dinner?""""The dinner comes with the position sir"" says his aide Colonel Charlie Flynn.""Hey Charlie"" McChrystal says ""does this come with the position?""McChrystal gives him the middle finger.Copyright Â© 2010 AFP.

"     We were married for fiften years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only two weeks . Before his death we are happy husband and wife Christian family. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was a live he deposited the sum of ( USD $1.Million ) (One Million U.S. Dollars)in the privet security company here in Cote d'Ivoire,This money still with the securyty company.     Recently, my Doctor told me that i have serious sickness which is Cadiac problem.The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to your church or individual that will utilize this money according to God's direction.I want your church to use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.     The Bible made us to know that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I donï¿½t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I donï¿½t want my husbandï¿½s efforts to be used by self acclaimed Christians.      I donï¿½t want in a way that this money will be used ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision to hand you over this Fund. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the hand of the Lord Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my problems and I shall hold my peace.      I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my straint. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.Please do give urgent response to this mail without any delay.

There isno better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with thefamilies who lost friends and loved ones and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm theircommitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces which organized the voting andensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country Iraqi men and women from all parts of thecountry were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel whosupported this historic effort.Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months we will worktogether with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus with the goal ofbuilding a long-term multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute tostability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq.###,0

Talks.docI have not been able to get a psychology dinner set up but I have found the article that you read onthe difference an apology can make in the Middle East (coming in next email) and commissioned auseful paper from Louise Diamond an expert on psychology and negotiations who has done a lotof work between the Israels and the Palestinians herself (attached). It's about 5 pages; I really thinkit is worth a read. Finally on changing the frame to look forward I strongly recommend that youspend 8 minutes to look at a video produced by a Rand study called The Arc which proposes ahigh-speed road/rail project connecting the key cities in the West Bank and Gaza. It is a powerfulpowerful vision of what could be one that will play right into Bibi's emphasis on economic growth.For my money it would be worth a private 8 minutes screening.

"Direct and private cell number +447024075280Direct and private Telephone  + 448714749902Direct and private fax number  + 448701310683Dear Friend,I am Mr. T. smith , deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication.Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )Thanks and regards.TONY SMITH",1

Your information were givento me by a member of the South African ExportPromotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the BlackEconomic Empowerment Commission (Government)delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreigninvestors. I have decided to seek a confidentialco-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunderfor the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keepit confidential because of the nature of thisbusiness. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I workas the Director of Project Implementation, withco-operation of two other top officials, we have inour possession, an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of thecontract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by aforeign contracting firm, which we the officialsover-invoiced to the amount ofUS$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five HundredThousand United States Dollars). Though the actualcontract cost has been paid to the originalcontractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believethat private investment in general, and foreign directinvestment in particular, are the real engines forsustainable economic development, for which reason ithas continued to encouraged investment in the keygrowth-oriented sector of Mining with sinceredetermination to pay foreign contractors all debtsowed to them, so as to continue to enjoy closerelationship, and mutually beneficial co-operationwith foreign governments and non-governmentalfinancial agencies. As a result we included our billsfor approvals with the co-operation of some officialsat the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank ofSouth Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance tobe the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since weare not allowed to operate foreign account. Thechanging of beneficiary's information/ details andother forms of documentation upon application forclaim to reflect the contract money and its approvalswill be secured on behalf of your company or yourself. I have the authority of my colleagues involved topropose that, should you be willing to assist us inthis transaction your share as compensation will be20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, andthe balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse allexpenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses soincurred. It does not matter whether or not your company doescontract projects of the nature described here. Theassumption is that your company won the major contractand subcontracted it to other companies. More oftenthan not, big trading companies and firms of unrelatedfields win major contracts, and subcontract to morespecialized firms for execution. This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treatit with utmost confidentiality. Also yourspecialization is not a hindrance to the successfulexecution of this mutual beneficiary transaction.

"Falomo Complex, Ikoyi- Lagos.dglobalfax@yahoo.comI am Edwin Useni, a director in the project and planning department of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), I head a seven man Tenders Board Committee in charge of contract award and Payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (NNPC) among which were;  1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation - US$2 Billion.  2) Contract for Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of various Refineries in the country.  3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots)-US$94 Million.  The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced in the sum of Twenty Five million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars US$25,500,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount into your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed in you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 15% of the transferred sum, 5% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance to us in due course.  You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions; our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry 0f Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above terms.  Our assurance is that your role shall be totally risk-free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of funds, the whole procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide final beneficiary.  Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years in the Civil Service of my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite immediate action as we are well behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the second batch of the 2001 fiscal year contract payments.  BEST REGARDS.  Dr. Edwin Useni. - Edwin Useni",1

" ""MY GOOD WILL""Good day and God bless,Greetings to you in the name of God Almighty. I am former Mrs. Memunat Farouk Hasan, now I am Mrs. Rebecca Farouk Hasan a widow to Late Farouk Hasan MuHammad.I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:(http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in BOMB ATTACK LONDON.My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries.This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recentlyrelocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work. Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity.I await your reply.",1

"Dear friend,I want to solicit with you for assistance in regards to a financialtransaction.  I am the son of one of the foremost and rich black farmers inZimbabwe that was murdered for land dispute in my country. Before the deathof my father, he had given me the certificate of deposite he used to deposita large sum of money in one of the private security companies in Europe, asfamily valuables, when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe.This amountwas meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals forthe farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This landdispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new landreform,which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a fewblack farmers (my father included).This resulted in the gruesome killing ofrich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their propertiesby Mugabe's war veterans, under the  disguise of fighting for the interestof the country. It is against this background that I fled the country withmy family,to the United Kingdom where we are currently seeking asylum.I havebeen adviced to seek foreign assistance, as the United Kingdom law prohibitsasylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financialtransaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is yourtrustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help mewith investment opportunities. My family's survival depends on this moneyas we have virtually lost all our other assets.There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept a negotiablepercentage of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnershipfor the proper investment of the money in your country.We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.I await your reply through my confidential email media, while I implore youto maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch freetransaction.I shall furnish you with more details on request.Yours truly,",1

"                   Dear Friend In Christ, I believe you will treat this mail with the fear of God. It is with tears that I am writing you this mail; I don`t need your pity, but love to my son. My mail may seem very painful and sorrowful, but there is more you can do in my request than to pity me, which is to show LOVE to my son. I was an orphan and do not wish my son to experience what i have been through on Earth after an automobile crash that nearly claimed my life. My name is Edward Brown, married to the late Juan J.Brown, who died with our two daughters in Indonesia on 26th of December 2004 during the Tsunami Disaster, after this Painful and sorrowful incident, my condition worsened and I was diagnosed of cancer, which got worst and I have been suffering from heart failure and hepatitis since. My friends ignored me due to my relationship with God on sickbed. My wife, our children and I have been in United Kingdom for a long time. We all were suppose to travel to Indonesia in December 2004, but my bad health, did not permit me to travel with them, which made me and my son stay behind while my wife and our two daughters traveled. If not, all of us would have perished in the disaster. My reason of writing you this mail is due to the sad news that came to me recently from the doctors. After my last diagnosed result, it was proved by the doctors that i may not leave for more than one month ahead, due to the damage the cancer have caused in my system unless I undergo an urgent surgical operation which my chance of survival is less than 10% according to the medical experts. As it stands, I have given to fate and have found God on sick bed. But i have a more concern problem, which is why I have contacted you. Please, this is about my son. Since it is now obvious that i will die, my son's future has been the greatest problem i have. I want you to take care of my son please. He is only 13years and we have no person here to take care of him if I die today. My friends for knowing God deserted me. I left some money in a deposit house at United Kingdom, which i intended to use for investment in Indonesia. I want you to take this money and my son. Use the money into a big investment, that you will manage until my son grows up to take over the investment. I will like you to take my son as your own son, give him the love we the parents would have given him. Do not let him feel the pains of being an orphan, give him good education, bring him up into a responsible man. Make him have the fear of God. Please do not refuse this task. I have no one else to help me out on this issue, I am an orphan who grew up without knowing God rather focused on wealth and otherwise, living a life of fantasy and doesn't care or know who God is. Do not pity me, rather take good care of and bring him up to be God fearing. As soon as I receive your reply including your personal details, all i will do is to authorize my bank to transfer the money to your account directly and i will also draw up my will in your favor. I will give the bank all the documents that is covering the deposit with the bank, i will transfer every power and right of ownership to you stating at my Will to enable you claim the deposit from the bank. It will be also included in the Will that you are the only person my son should be released to, if i die. All i need is your acceptance and assurance that you will not treat my son badly. I am writing you this mail with great tears and i pray you will be kind & honest with fear of God concerning this mail to you today.",1

"Mrs. Grace ObasekiFlat 8 Block 12 NNPC QuartersGarki Abuja NigeriaEmail, graceobaseki2004@yahoo.comHELLO DEAR.I presume this letter will come to you as a surprise, butas things unfold, we will  know each other better. I will start by introducingmyself to you.  I am Mrs Grace Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson GaiusObaseki,the Managing Director, and Chief Executive, NigerianNationalPetroleum orporation (NNPC).  I am really sure that you will be of a good assistanceafter goingthoroughly through this letter.For many years of marriage now between me and my husband,I have notgiven birth, and this has really troubled my husband. As aresultof the respect given to local tradition culture and customhere inNigeria, my husband has decided to break the marriage.With thesituation of things with me now, my matrimonial home lookbleak.I am been threatened daily by my husband to get out fromthe home.My Husband s brothers are not left out in this matter.Thissituation has really affected me psychologically.As at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,hence I seekyour urgent assistance and help which I know will go along way ingetting me settled finally.I want to use this opportunity to move the sum of (US$18M)into yourcustody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in yourcountry. Thissaid amount was given to my husband as gratification fromsomeForeign Oil Companies he helped in getting Allocation forthe Drilling ofCrude Oil in Nigeria.As a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hencehe gave methis money to keep in my personal account so that he canbeexonerated from the eyes of government security operativesand the CivilService Commission (CSC) which is a body that scrutinizestheactivities of all civil servants in Nigeria as checks andbalances forofficial misconduct.Be informed that this money is not connected with drugs;moneylaundry, firearms and looting which I believe will putfears in you torender the required assistance needed from you andconsequentlywithdrawing your help for security reasons.Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear.This money wasdeposited in my personal name, and there is no way it canbetransferred telegraphically under the banking procedureswhich couldhave been the easiest, but because of monetary transferrestrictionby the Federal Government of Nigeria, that is defeated.Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to move thismoney out incash to any destination where it will be easy for you tocollectunder diplomatic immunity.This he has assured me of. As a soon as I see yourresponse andwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish youon the nextline of action to take, but be rest assured that thistransactionis 100% risk free, and my husband will not raise any alarmbecausehe will not like to put himself, his job and office injeopardy,and if he does, he stands the change of loosing his job.As soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm tome that youhave received it, I will be coming to meet you up there inyourcountry where I wish to live the rest of my life.I will be offering you 20% of this money for all your helpat thistime of need, while some percentages has been set asidefor myBrother to complement his efforts here.Be informed that this transaction will not last more than14working days and it  will be concluded because every arrangement has been putin place.Your negative or positive response will be highlyappreciated.

Early last year there was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities homeless. A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been completed and the original contractor has long been paid,but the contract balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK, This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones. To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount into your account. We are ready to share this money with you on the basis of participation.we also have plans to invest part of this money in any viable business in your country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement age. In any case, I received a reference of you/organization from the Nigeria CHambers of Commerce and Industry =91Foreign Trade Division=92as a reputable organ that can assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply to me on my e-mail:(bello_dd@doctor.com)or(obilolo@netscape.net) so that I can provide you with the basic procedures for the release of the fund.  It does not matter whether you or your company does contract project of the nature described here, the assumption is that you won a major contract and subcontracted it to another company, more often thannot, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside to cover any expenses thatmay be incurred by both parties during this transaction, both local and international. Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction could be accomplished within the shortest possible time based on your interest and determination,since the money is already on transit.",1

sbwhoeopMonday April 5 2010 6:30 PMH: UK election being called. SidGordon is going to call the election tomorrow for May 6. I'm going to go over for that week. SidLabour c.uIi win most seats at eneralelection poll showsGuardian/ICM poll reveals gap between two main parties at four points â€” the closest in an ICM poll for almost two yearsâ€¢ Julian Gloverâ€¢ aardian.co.uk Monday 5 April 2010 19.02 BSTâ€¢ Article historyLbr still has a fighting chance of winning the most seats in the general election according to a Guardian/1CM pollpublished today.The findings suggest Tory hopes of a defining breakthrough have been overplayed with the gap between the two mainparties now at just four points â€” the closest in an 1CM poll for almost two years.Labour support has climbed four points to 33% since an ICM poll carried out for the Guardian last week. Conservativebacking has dropped one since then to 37% â€” Labour's best ICM rating since December 2008 and the Tories' worst sinceFebruary.On a uniform national swing these figures could leave Labour 30 seats short of an overall majority. Even if the Toriesperform better than average in marginal seats â€” as most people expect â€” David Cameron would struggle to establish asecure parliamentary basis for power.Either party could be left dependent on the fiber:a) Democrats who are on 21% in the poll â€” down two from last week.Despite that decline the Lib Dems will be pleased by the strength of their position going into the election. The party hasbeen at or above 20% in seven of this year's 11 ICM polls.Meanwhile support for other parties which peaked last spring in the European elections has fallen again to just 9%.At the start of an election campaign likely to see more polling than ever before in British politics today's figures will betreated with caution unless confirmed by other surveys.Some polls late last week suggested the Conservative lead had grown rather than shrunk and research may have beenaffected by the Easter holidays when some voters would have been away from home. Yet the results suggest thatLabour's chances should not be written off and events such as the leaders' debates could prove decisive in the comingweeks.Today's poll suggests 60% of people are planning to watch at least one debate with 29% saying they plan to watch allthree. Only 39% of voters said they would not watch any of them.The ICM survey also asked voters whether they might switch away from their first choice party and if so;who they mightback instead.Labour and Tory support is now equally solid. Overall 71% of Labour supporters say they will definitely back Labour while71% of Tories also say they will stick with their first choice party.Lib Dems however are less loyal â€” only 52% are sure they will end up giving Nick Clegg their vote. That leaves just overa quarter of each main party's supporters considering backing another party.The proportion of Lib Dems and ConservatIves. saying they might vote Labour instead has doubled since ICM last askedthis question earlier in the year. The ICM figures suggest the maximum potential vote for Labour and the Conservatives â€”all their definite supporters plus all potential switchers â€” is running neck and neck at 42%. The Lib Dem maximum is 28%.Realistically Labour is unlikely to beat its 2005 share of 36% and even today's poll suggesting it has shed only threepoints since then will surprise many. Nonetheless there is all to play for as the contest begins now.â€¢ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone on 1-3 April 2010.Interviews were conducted across the country and the results weighted to the profile of all adults. 1CM is a member of theBritish Polling Council and abides by its rules.,0

"Madam SecretaryJake mentioned that you asked for more information about a proposal made in 2005 for a global CT organization and heasked me to find out a little about it. Below is some brief information on the proposal which was made by Saudi Arabia:The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an internationalcounterterrorism center ""under the auspices of the UN."" The purpose of the organization would be to among otherthings ""develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States"" on a wide range of non-military counterterrorism issues encourage the establishment of national and regional centers and provide assistanceto developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center as conceived in 2005 would also allow nationalcounterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA)but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to beinterested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly recently there have been discussions between the UN andSaudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementationof the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and thedifferent CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and havemultilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.But S/CT mentioned that if we were to move forwardon S/CT's CFO idea we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.Please let me know if you would like any further info.ThanksMikeMichael H.

"http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/11/the-return-of-ghosts-debating-the-rise-of-geert-wilders-and-the-far-right/The Return of Ghosts: Debating the rise of Geert Wilders andthe far-right at the Nexus SymposiumOn 11.18.10 By MaxThe Nexus Institute's Return of Ghosts conference was inspired by the rise of far-right politician Geert Wilders in theNetherlandsI spent last week in Amsterdam where I participated in the ""Return of Ghosts"" symposium of the Nexus Institute adiscussion/debate about the resurgence of neo-fascism in Europe and anti-democratic trends in the West. Besidesproviding a forum for debating European politics the symposium was the occasion for the first public appearance inEurope by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month. The arrivalof Vargas Llosa one of the world's foremost intellectuals resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutchmedia the country's political class and the royal family.Even with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight the participants' attention was focused on Geert Wilders the leader of the far-rightDutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands. With hisgathering influence Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold; the governmentmeets with him every Wednesday to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions. While Wilders dictates at will to thegovernment he remains independent of it comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape. Itis the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism and typical strategyof the far-right in countries across the continent.Wilders' base lies in the mostly Catholic south where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim. He has alsogenerated support in the city of Groeningen once a citadel of the communists. Seeking to expand his base Wilderspromised to hire scores of ""animal cops"" to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals a clever wedge strategy in theonly country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights. Of course Wilders could care less about ourfurry friends. His stated goal is to end immigration not just to Holland but to all of Europe; ban the Quran (free speech isonly for the ""Judeo-Christian"" community) and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by for instanceinstituting what he called a ""head rag tax"" on Muslim women. Wilders' international allies include the goosestepping neo-Nazis of the English Defense League the far-right pogromist Pam Geller the Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belangand a substantial portion of the US neocon elite. Over the course of just a few years he has become perhaps the mostinfluential Islamophobe in the world.But does this make Wilders a fascist? Rob Riemen the director of the Nexus Institute thinks so. Riemen has justpublished a book entitled ""De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme"" or ""The Eternal Return of Fascism"" (I eagerly awaitits English translation) dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders' eerily familiar brand of right-wing populism. In thebook Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders' politics to the early incarnations of European fascism not to thegenocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II. He calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists ""one-and-one."" In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing Riemen warns that reactionaryfigures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively refusing to call a spadea spade. Where Wilders' ascendancy will lead is unknown but if he is not stopped in his tracks Riemen is certain theB6story will not end well. In the week after its publication Riemen's book flew off the shelves selling 5000 copies whilegenerating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate.Riemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as ""un-Dutch."" In Dutch culture as in so many others open confrontation is avoided at all cost. Political disagreement iswelcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner as though nothing more than reputations were at stake. So theDutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along. The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemedto have alarmed and frustrated him. Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clearresonances of fascism in Wilders' political style? he wondered. And why did they seem more concerned with regulatingthe terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far-right? Once the symposium opened and I was able tosee the Dutch elite in action I began to understand Riemen's indignation.The symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa a complex personality who has allied himself with center-rightparties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa'sdifferences with leaders of the left which he used to belong to exploded over the issue of free trade. He is an ardent neo-liberal and reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez and 011anta Humala who advocate protectionism and industrialnationalization.Vargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracyparticularly in Europe. But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed toWestern civilization. Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon pointing to theMadrid and London bombings by al-Qaida inspired operatives while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by seculargroups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosadeclared in his speech that ""Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation"" and has been harshly critical of the statein the past).During the first panel which I participated in Fania Oz-Salzberger an Israeli professor of history and the daughter offamed author Amos Oz boasted to crowd of Israel's ""vibrant democracy."" She was enthusiastically seconded by MitchellCohen a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti-Zionist Jews writing that ""thedominant species of anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism."" I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over thealmost endless stream of anti-democratic laws passing through the Knesset or by the general authoritarian anti-liberaltrend in Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that ""Geert Wilders and politicianslike him are not welcomed by Israelis.""Yet Wilders is one of Israel's most frequent guests having visited the country over 40 times in 20 years. In fact he claimsthat his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav. ""Nowhere did I have the special feeling ofsolidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport"" he once said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutchfinancial backers of Israel and has met with a range of Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within the extremist settlermovement prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan. Members of the liberal Zionistintelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may not not want Wilders around but who in Israel is listening to them? Israel'smainstream leadership echoes Wilders' crudest talking points on a regular basis while the Zionist left clings to a dwindlinghandful of Knesset seats and watches passively â€” even resentfully â€” as a rag-tag band of leftist radicals fights forequality for all. Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert who is seen as a centrist within theIsraeli political spectrum: ""The origin of terrorism is within Islam"" Olmert declared this month.The pro-Israel position of the new breed of European far-rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenientpolitical tactic. Of course saying you ""stand with Israel"" as Wilders so often does is an easy way to insulate yourself fromcharges of anti-Semitism. But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highestideals. While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid stateâ€” and they like it. They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell;they admire Israel's settler culture; and most of all they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majorityabove all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass. The endgameof the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli.After the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D'Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country citing PMSilvio Berlusconi's control over 90 percent of the country's media the government's deep seated corruption and the PrimeMinister's repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom Riemen asked me if the United Stateswas a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections. After two panelistshad described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non-democratic quasi-dictatorship I decidedthat our definition of democracy was subjective at best. So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatestblows to American democracy from the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Actto the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later in the evening D'Arcais would remark to me with amazement that henever knew American media was ever regulated in the first place.During the 20 minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel one student askedwhether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon apparently referring to Vargas Llosa's address. I respondedthat it of course was not citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic into practicethe second suicide. I recommended the audience review the research of Robert Pape the University of Chicago politicalscientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli occupation of Middle Eastern countriesand the motivations of suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in proclaiming that occupation has little or nothing to dowith the motives of suicide bombers. She did not marshal any evidence to support her point possibly because our timewas so limited. It would have been hard to do so however without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders aboutIslam's inherent violence â€” or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov thatsuicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression.Next the Dutch panel took the stage. The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein the longtime leader of the People's Party forFreedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide providing him a stepping stone to his politicalcareer. He was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the ""paleocon"" charactersI've met while covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance.""Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the 90's with the idea of the 'good stranger""Bolkstein declared. ""If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws there would not have been a Mr.Wilders.""The only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor PaulFrissen who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects ""the right to be fundamentalist."" Theother panelists either gave Bolkstein's xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims. AfterBolkstein lightly criticized Wilders' call for banning the Quran remarking that ""what he says about Islam is nonsense""because it contradicts the freedom of religion AB Klink a former Dutch senator and ex-Minister of Health chimed in.""It'snot nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours"" Klink claimed.Then when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools Frissen reminded him that state-supported Christianschools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well. Meindert Fennema the political biographer of Wildersentered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed. ""I'm against all forms of religious teaching!"" he proudlyexclaimed sending gales of applause through the audience. ""How can you call yourself a liberal?"" Frissen asked with atone of exasperation. Fennema ignored him.During question time a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the""ghost of neo-colonialism"" which ""the African people never voted for."" She mentioned the exploitative deals forced ondeveloping countries by transnational oil companies possibly alluding to Bolkstein's role as a manager at Royal DutchShell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador Indonesia and Honduras during the 1970's (I'm sure nothing unseemlyhappened during Bo!stein's tenure in these places). Bolkstein's responded bluntly ""If these countries try to be self-sufficient it just doesn't work!""After the symposium I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends who were mostly immigrant students. They wereappalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists. ""None of them knew the first thing about Islam"" an Arab studentremarked. ""They couldn't even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe."" Ginwala added ""How can Bolksteintell me my country can't be self-sufficient? I come from India. It's one of the most diversified economies on the planet.""I was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting. However I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke towere closely and nervously following the rise of the right. At the airport while waiting to board my flight I talked to a 20-something security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was. Muhammad had spent his whole lifein Amsterdam but his parents were from Cairo Egypt. He told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New YorkCity and Miami someday. When I brought up the topic of Wilders he scoffed at his perception of Muslims. ""Most of usaren't even religious"" Muhammad said. ""When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over I just laugh. I'm likeis this guy serious?""But he did not underestimate Wilders' appeal. ""Everything he does and everything he says it seems like it's carefullyplanned. He obviously knows what he's doing. And they let him get away with it"" Muhammad remarked. ""Look I'm just acitizen I'm nobody but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesn't like I'll be punished. Butwhen Wilders who is a public official says all the things he says about Muslims nothing happens to him. Instead moreand more people are voting for him.""",0

"FROM MR.MAZURI MARTINSJOHANESSBURG,2001REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA.PHONE+27 73 130 8560                                       STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALSir/Madam,You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not knowme personally. I am Mr. Mazuri Martins the first son of Mr.Philip Mazuri,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe .I got yourcontact through the internet network online hence I decided to write you.Before the death of my father, he travelled to Johannesburg to deposit thesum of US$ 25.5Million (Twenty Five  Million Five  Hundred Thousand UnitedStates Dollars) only, in one of the private security/finance companies, asif he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This money was deposited inthe security / finance company as family valuables and consignment toavoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant forthe purchase of new machines/ farm machineries and chemicals for the farmsand establishment of a new farm   in Swaziland because he is the chairmanof the farmers association while Mum was the treasurer.This land problem came ( and is still on )  when our President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the richwhite farmers  and some few black  farmers. This resulted to the killingand mob action by the Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in thesociety hijacked the opportunity.  In fact, lot of people were killedbecause of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of thevictims, the news about the crisis in Zimbabwe is every where both in theCNN and BBC.It is against this background that, I and my family  who are currentlystaying in South Africa now decided to transfer my fatherï¿½s money to aforeign country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees(politicalasylum seekers)  to open any bank  account or to be involved in anyfinancial  transaction throughout the  territorial zones of South Africa. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility ofseeking a genuine foreign partner with a good bank account where thismoney could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government whoare bent on taking everything.All I seek for is your seriousness, for I am entrusting my future and thatof my family into your hands .I must also let you know that thistransaction is 100%risk free.

We are presently affected by the SouthAfrica Civil service code of conduct laws thatprohibits civil servants from operating privateforeign accounts.I have discussed this issue with the Bank Manager whoI must involve for a smooth and successful transfer ofthe fund to any account, which you will provide.However, I want you to act as the next of kin to thedeceased by providing your bank account where the fundwill be transferred for immediate investment on anyviable project. The banking ethics here does not allowsuch fund to stay more than 2 years without claimhence the fund will be recalled to the governmenttreasury as unclaimed fund after this period ofdormancy.I got your contact through my personal search to seeif you can assist by providing your safe bank accountfor the transfer or find a reliable person capable ofreceiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclusion, 65% of the fund will be for me. 20%for you, 10% for charity both in Africa and in yourcountry and the remaining 5% will be set aside forexpenses both parties might incurred during thetransfer process.Kindly e-mail, fax or call me as soon as you receivesthis email.

We have been safeguardingthis money for conducive time for it's transfer out of the country for ourpersonal use. However, the code of employment does not allow us (civil servant)to own and operate foreign account and because the contract was handledby a foreign firm and the payment made in dollars, we now need a foreignpartner that will present himself as the sub-contractor so that the fundwill be transfer into your company's or personal account. Your address wasmade available to us by a very good friend who work with the Nigeria exportpromotion council and he assured us of your company's viability and capabilityin business transaction.

"Zhang He, Bank of China.. ShenzhenChina. Dear Friend, I am Zhang He, Bank Manager of the Bank of China, Shenzhen branch, China. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 7, 2000, a consultant/ contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at Twenty One Million Dollars (US$21,000,000.00) only in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation that he died along with his wife from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died Without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of China, at the expiration of eight (8) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to assist me in receiving this money as I have every machinery set to enable you receiver this money via a Finance firm based overseas. I need your urgent assistance so that this money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will require you to send me your complete names, contact address and telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to apply for the necessary documents to enable you receive the money via the Finance firm overseas in your name. After receiving the money, we will share in the ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you. Note that the project will be 100% risk free. Considering my position as the credit officer of the bank, I guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. I have the facilities to obtain relevant documents to enable me lift the money from the bank overseas. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I will also let you have the contact details of the Finance Firm and the country it is located in Overseas. Please send me your confidential TELEPHONE and FAX Numbers for fast communication, as I will need to speak to you to personally. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Please reply through my secure email zhanghe_1967@163.com Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.  Zhang He.",1

"FROM BONGO WALEJOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.TELL:+27-732112866.Dear sir,I am MR, BONGO WALE, the son of lateMR.PATRICK WALE, who was murdered in a land disputein ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search forreliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidentialfinancial transaction, then I decided to write you. Mylate father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of theruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean oppositionparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to SouthAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars($12m) with a security and finance company, as if heknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money wasdeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid muchdumourage from the security firm.This money was earmarked for the purchase of newmachinery and chemicals for the farms and theestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when President R. MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying in SouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma ofclaiming/investing this amount of money in SouthAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience infuture since both countries have the same politicalhistory. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law doesnot allow such investment hence I am seeking foran asylum or refugee.I must let you know that this business is 100% riskfree and the nature of your business does notnecessary matter. So if you are willing to assist usclaim the ownership of this money,I and my family haveagreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will befor a joint business venture I will be doing with youand another 35% will be for me and my family which weshall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%will be mapped out for all expenses we may incureduring the transaction.Therefor, if you are willing and interested to renderthe needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Faxnumberfor easy and better communication.Remember that this is highly confidential and thesuccess of this business depends on how secret it is kept.Expecting your reply soonest.Best Regard.BONGO WALE",1

""But until we've got the leaks plugged it's incumbent on all our diplomats to put on their lying caps.""Clinton noted that since many U.S. diplomats are major political donors with long careers in the business world ""thisshouldn't be a reach for them."" But for those career diplomats who came up through the Foreign Service the StateDepartment will be holding a series of ""truth avoidance seminars"" led by executives of Goldman Sachs.Additionally Clinton said the State Department would install on all diplomats' computers new software calledCandorShield' which automatically translates truthful language into a less embarrassing truth-free version. Forexample she explained the software would translate the phrase ""two-faced weasels"" into ""trusted Pakistani allies"" andwould delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as ""Monsieur Shorty Pants.""Elsewhere Interpol issued this statement about its pursuit of WikiLea.ks founder Julian Assange: ""We will find JulianAssange and then we will hire him.""",0

"Hillary: Peter Galbraith just called me and I had a long talk with him. As you know as chief of USmission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come into conflict with the headof UN there who wanted to cover it up. Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid monthsthere. He is pessimistic says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong-headed that comparisons ofincreasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided but thinksthere is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replaceKarzai. He wishes to speak with you directly. He says that he has difficulty communicating withHolbrooke not because he can't reach him but because he finds Dick disjointed these days. Peter ison a plane right now to Norway then London then to NY on Wed then could go to DC. He says youcan reach him through the US mission to the UN office. FYI from Wash Post today:""The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges and whether to force a runoff has also caused a rarepublic rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission Peter W.Galbraith left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director Norwegian Kai Eide.""Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorizedto. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because itcould undermine national stability.Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number ofpolling stations in some areas in the south the incumbent's ethnic stronghold said one diplomatic source. Eideand others the source said were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities couldbe smoothed over as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin.""And I've included below Jane Smiley's rave review of Max's book.Sidhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah_b290293.htmlYour request is being processed...Jane SmileyPulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and EssayistPosted: September 17 2009 02:56 PMHuffPost Book Review: Republican GomorrahAbout twenty years ago I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store.The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gunwent off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. He never said ""I shot aman."" It just happened.I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific but also of course appalling new bookRepublican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican partywho does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her ownsuccess or failure sin or redemption. It just happens.The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats guns at ralliesunhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel absolute sense ofpowerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about themurderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments the clerk knew it. But the killer no matterhow well armed never felt it.Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the variousRepublican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing.They invoke the name of God for purposes that sHame God absolutely--hurting destroying maiming anddamning others who either don't accept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Ofcourse that is frightening.But Blumenthal's cast of characters beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son Ryan and including JohnHagee Sarah Palin Ralph Reed Charles Colson Judith Reisman Christina Regnery Donald Wildmon et al.strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric narrow minded uneducated selfish and resentful.Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even thoseof us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about thepower that they wish to exert.Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes thenetwork. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected toErik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connectedto Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson and so forth and in the course oftracing these connections he informs us or reminds us of the crimes and misdemeanors these people havecommitted.Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--didhe not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel inNew Orleans where Republicans ""wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans haveimpeccable taste in silk stockings"" (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes--both those we've already heard of such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard's and those we haven't (there is goodevidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis funder of the right wing Council For National Policy orderedhits on his estranged wife and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend).This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of AJustified Sinner by James Hogg in which once a man believes he is among the saved he can commit any sin hewants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was ""saved"" for example he said ""My goal is to get toheaven. I'll do anything it takes to get there and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way."" He must havethought getting to heaven was just another power play.And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing thatBlumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully a man like Jack Abramoffwhose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates but who sang like a bird once he was caught.At the center of is James Dobson a much more destructive figure than Abramoff who advocates in thestrongest terms child beating and not only child-beating but dog-beating. At one point he brags about goingafter the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in ""the most vicious fight ever stagedbetween man and beast."" As for children the goal is to keep beating the child until ""he wants(s) to crumple onthe breast of his parent."" In other words Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny and whoover the years has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture Blumenthalcites Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism and EricHoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation Blumenthal points out how many of thesepowerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number.The beatings often arbitrary cruel and frequent were then in many cases backed up with constant lessonsabout God--that he is arbitrary that he is cruel that he demands obedience above all things and that hesurpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child his sHameand guilt as a worthless sinner and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in thehierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology but in my view not far enough. I'm sure he was reared byliberal parents who gave him a sense of responsibility curiosity and autonomy and since he is only in histhirties I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has beeninterviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is howconstant it is and how arousing it is. I don't think in fact that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. Ithink he looks within and says ""I'm okay; you're okay."" That's the goal of liberal parenting and as we can tellby statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy divorce and occurrence of STDs liberal parenting works--atheists and agnostics for example have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals and states that havesex education in the schools rather than abstinence-only education have lower rates of teen pregnancy.But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes nosense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself or even to tryto figure out what oneself might be is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conformingto a group and as a part of that group dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group canbe anything at all as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by themtoo or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terrorcan only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power because in relation to his parents and to God he isdefined as powerless. When he ""crumples"" on the ""loving"" breast of his parent (and in my view a person whoadministers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he accepts hispowerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life.That's where your freedom and mine come in.Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is they differ from the Talibanonly in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups to nevershare power to control every aspect of every life within their power and to create society as a steeplyhierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocideof 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace loveand understanding but Rushdoony went the other way taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. Inhis book The Institutes of Biblical Law he advocates capital punishment for ""disobedient children unchastewomen apostates blasphemers practitioners of witchcraft adulterers"" and homosexuals. Gary North thePresbyterian Christian Reconstructionist is his son-in-law and while not backing down on the mass deathpenalty advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is afactor because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of youand me if they could catch us) well Christians would but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to acceptresponsibility they assign agency to God who wants us killed who will beat us until we ""crumple"" on his""loving"" breast a God who has given us all sorts of talents skills and interests but is like these ChristianDominionists interested only in power. I believe his motto is ""Adore me or I will hurt you.""Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children I too got frustrated and I toothought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physicalpunishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge abouteffective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing in which a woman who firmly believed in child-between man and beast.""

I soon realized that my motives for administering physicalpunishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge abouteffective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing in which a woman who firmly believed in child-beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter and had much more family disruption than theparents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works withhorses dogs and other animals too. It was then I decided that if I in my human weakness could put two andtwo together concerning free will and proper behavior surely God could also. I didn't want to believe in a Godwho was a smaller being than myself. And I don't.The ray of hope in Blumenthal's book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologicallyunstable that they don't have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thingabout that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin Conrad Burns (R-MT) George Allen (R-VA) Rick Santorum (R-PA) James Talent (R-MO) and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us ""back from thebrink"" according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that theywould not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing isthat they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view well I thinkStalinism lasted about 25 years Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia andGermany survived Iran might as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitlerdidn't have nuclear weapons.I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probablyhad no idea that his killer had no sense of agency hardly even knew what he was doing was seeing his hand asseparate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer too subject to feelings that he could not label thatwere terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten sHamed and neglected as a child. I bet afterward hewished someone somehow had stopped him.Don't forget to buy one: Max Blumenthal Republican Gomorrah Nationbooks available at your localbookstore and anywhere else thatbooks are sold.Read more at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah b 290293.html",0
They got cloture on DADT. 63 to 33.At the close of the 30 hours (or when they yield back) we are back on START. We were able to convince Reid thismorning not to file cloture on the treaty which would have played in to Kyl's hands. So we are likely to have one fullmore day of debate and some votes on amendments then file cloture setting up a cloture vote early next week. Mccainand GraHam are still in a grumpy place - GraHam is worse than McCain and we may have lost him. But McCain is stillvery much in the game.,0

Below is the final text of the Quartet statement which Lavrov Ban and Ashton have now agreed to release *without acall.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza including the humanitarian and human rights situation of thecivilian population is unsustainable unacceptable and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartetreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns including an end to weaponssmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and thereunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow ofhumanitarian aid commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza consistent with United Nations Security Councilresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel the Palestinian Government andinternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation ofthe Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.Consistent with these objectives the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel as well asconsulting the Palestinian Authority Egypt and other concerned parties to effect a fundamental change in policy inGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartetnotes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring theeffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towardsmeeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods civilian reconstruction andinfrastructure and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to workwith Israel the Palestinian Authority and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented asquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above and inconsultation with the concerned parties it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It willactively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings andpromote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions as well as the work of localnon-governmental organizations to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs and calls on all parties to fullyenable this work.The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded and believesefforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. TheQuartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms andammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that theircargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need forunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of hiscapture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by theInternational Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption without pre-conditions of directbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes thesenegotiations should lead to a settlement negotiated between the parties within 24 months that ends the occupationwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent democratic and viable Palestinian state in theWest Bank and Gaza living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.,0

"        charset=""iso-8859-1""Dear friend, I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Kenneth Masuku, the first and only surviving son of late Marc Masuku one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father, he had given me the certificate of deposite he used to deposit the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five Hundred United State Dollars) in one of the private security companies in Europe, as family valuables, when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe's war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum. I have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family's survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets. There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 15% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you. I await your reply through the above media, while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction. I shall furnish you with more details on request. Yours truly, Kenneth Masuku ",1
"HELLO FRIEND,Good day and Compliments, I am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it is the wish of God for you to help me and my family, God Almighty will bless and reward you abundantly and youwould never regret this.My family and I are true Christians and worship God truthfully. I got your contact during my search for this assistance. I am a female student from University Burkina Faso, Ouaga. I am 22 yrs old. I'd like any person who can be caring, loving and home oriented. I will love to havea long-term relationship with you and to know more about you.I would like to build up a solid foundation with you in time coming if you can be able to help me in this transaction. Well, my father died earlier three months ago and left I and my junior brother behind. Hewas a king, which our town citizens titled him over sixteen years beforehis death.I was a princess to him and I am the only person who can take care of his wealth now because my junior brother is still young and my mother is not literate enough to know my entire father's wealth.He left the sum of USD 7.350, 000M (Seven Million, Three Hundred and FiftyThousand US Dollars) in a security company.This money was annually paid into my late fathers account from Shell petroleum Development Company (spdc) and chevron Oil Company operating in our locality for the compensation of youth and community development in our jurisdiction.I don't know how and what I will do to invest this money somewhere in abroad, so that my father's kindred will not take over what belongs to my father and our family, which they were planning to do without my consentbecause I am a female as stated by our culture in the town.Now, I urgently need your humble assistance to move this money from the  Security Company to your bank account that is why I felt happy when I saw your contact because I strongly believe that by the grace of God,you will help me invest this money wisely.I am ready to pay 30% of the total amount to you if you help us in this transaction and another 10% interest of Annual after Income to you, for handling this transaction for us, which you will strongly have absolute control over it.If you can handle this project sincerely and also willing to assist me in lifting this fund, kindly reach me. Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free and I hope to commence the transaction as quick as possible, I will send you my picture as soon as I hear from you for recognition.Yours sincerely,",1

"DEAR ,My name is Mrs.ANNA WILLIAM  I am a dying woman who have decided to donate what I have to you/ church. I am 59 years old and I was diagnosed for cancer about 2 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband,who had left me everything he worked for.I have been touched by God to donate  from what I  have inherited from my late husband to  you for the good work of God,rather than allow my relatives to use my husband hard earned funds ungodly.Please pray, that the good Lord forgive me my sins. I have asked God to forgive me and i believe he has because He is a merciful God.I will be going in for an operation in less than four hours.I decided toWILL/donate the sum of $9,500,000(Nine Million Five hundred thousand Dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and also to help the motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the widows according to (JAMES 1:27). At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my relatives are around me and my health status. I have adjusted my WILL and my lawyer is aware i have changed my will and you and my lawyer will arrange the transfer of the funds the Security Company. I wish you all the best and may the Good Lord bless you  abundantly, and ",1
"Dearest in the Lord, I am the above named person from South Africa. I am married to Mr.GREOGE  SANKOH  who worked with South African embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child.  He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 5.5Million U.S.(FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDERD thousand Dollars) in a trunk box in one ( Security And Finance Company) in cote d' ivoire.Presently, this money is still with the Security And Finance Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next two years due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.  I want a church that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.  I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the BANK in ivory coast.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.  Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. any delay in your reply will give me room in searching for a church or christian individual for this same purpose.

"Kenya Commercial BankCity Centre, P.O. Box 44252,Nairobi.Kenya Email:dan@danielm.orgDear Sir/Madam, May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an =informal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly =with a formal meeting between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore =knowledge of the nature of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and =functions of both parties and appropriate shares accordingly.I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an =urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry =Of Energy, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar =months, valued at US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my =branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got =no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the =National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and =all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone =did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork =in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one =will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) =years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in =as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public =servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim =them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your =telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will =put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and =20% for you.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees =the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your =response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand =the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this =transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in =real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication =can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:Thanks and my regards.

"aned by Woodward's Fireby Leslie H. GelbSeptember 23 2010 I 1:32pmThe president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on thefalloutâ€”and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward Mr. First Draft of History repeatedly and boldly slipping behind theclosed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men werehelping The Washington Post's sleuth write ""the inside story"" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying ofHerculean laborsâ€”the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets many of his subordinates feel liberated to ""tell their side of thestory."" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials wellno one looks terribly heroic.Let's start with Obama who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he isâ€”brilliant emotionless abstract focusedand confused a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as abrilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery but thathe trudged on doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.The worst circumstance as Team Obama alleged to Woodward was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generalsdid not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below even far below whatthe generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down afterthey reached their projected peak of about 100000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). Themilitary didn't provide him with that either.As they say in Missouri ""Give me a break."" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get whathe wants from the U.S. military he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the WhiteHouse who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn'tunderstand what he had to doâ€”tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president'swishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so as Woodward describes Obama had to write thestrategy all by himself.This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clearenough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity topursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president toldWoodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the ""classic"" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. ""I think about itmore in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker atthe end?"" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one to Sen. Lindsey GraHam (R-SC) about whether the July 2011deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: ""I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end and I can't lose the wholeDemocratic Party."" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:""This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan."" So if he wanted such a plan heshould have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem the military smells vacillations.And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathomwell the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build uptheir arms and overall strength. But once in war they want only more troops fewer restrictions on their use and above allvictory victory victory. Since Vietnam they smell only vacillation among Democrats and they don't like it. For their partDemocrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them and they don't care for the suits either. It's nota happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality which is critical for Americans to understand.breakAdThe White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing overnaughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation the generalâ€”andperhaps even his senior Army aidesâ€”were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guysâ€”you know theusual culprits the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this but nothing good will come of them.There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that I believe he gets more wrong thanright. That is Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the innersanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. Myinformation has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources there is no doubtthat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Defense Secretary Bob Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almostalways quite cordial and in full lock step. They along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like GeneralMcChrystal and General Petraeus are the key players. Of course Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff RahmEmanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in publicâ€”inadvance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard almost all Obama's top advisers did asmuch. The day after his West Point speech last December where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecifiedU.S. troop withdrawals almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriouslythat everything was ""conditions based."" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.So if anything most of Obama's top counselors were more or less unitedâ€”sometimes against where he seemed to begoing. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals and it's a stunner: ""You have to recognizealso that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq actually.... Yes there has beenenormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay afterit. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives."" The brilliant general said as muchto others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.So far there are no heroes to this narrative only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight onforever.Doubtless President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again and I believehim despite his history of calling for ""victory"" and ""defeat"" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward bookdemonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far there are no heroes tothis narrative only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.Leslie H.

"FYI --Reid: Shelby Has Hold On All NomineesFriday Feb. 5 2010Sen. Richard Shelby R-Ala. has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effortto win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state accordingto aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid.Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. Reid can force a voteon any nomination by filing cloture.Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations the Senate processes most nominations by unanimousconsent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up.The nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture.While holds are frequent Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than isnormal.""He should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue"" a Democratic aide said. ""They're qualified and theyshould be moving forward.""Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republicanholds on executive nominees.'We've got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection tothem -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business"" President Obamasaid Wednesday in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats.On the Senate floor Thursday Reid Senate Majority Whip Durbin Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy andSenate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges.Reid who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush frommaking recess appointments said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments which the presidentcan make when the Senate is out of session.'What alternatives do we have?"" Reid said on the floor Thursday. ""What alternative do we have?""Earlier in the day a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on ""several pending nominees due tounaddressed national security concerns"" including frustrations with the Air Force's handling of the competition for anaerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold.Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS the European consortium behind Airbus and Boeing Co. are vying for the high-stakes contract potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile Ala. but hasthreatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals.""Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet we still do not have atransparent and fair acquisition process to move forward"" the spokesman said. ""The Department of Defense mustrecognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed.""Defense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposalssoon and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition.""Obviously we would like to have a competition for it and we hope that both companies will agree to participate but wewill move forward"" Gates said. ""We have to have new tankers.""In addition to the tanker issue Shelby's spokesman said he is frustrated that the Obama administration won't build anAlabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices.Shelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device AnalyticalCenter to be set up at the Army's Redstone Arsenal.""Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensicand technical exploitation related to IEDs but this administration's coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort"" thespokesman said. ""He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time.""Also Thursday Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot-dragging that he was consideringwhether Senate rules should be changed.""There's a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a supermajorityon almost everything"" Biden said moments after swearing in Sen. Scott Brown R-Mass. who gives Republicans 41votes enough to filibuster on any issue.'What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this you know the use of thefilibuster and how it's worked"" Biden said. ""This is not a constitutional requirement.""Biden defended the 60-vote requirement calling it ""a useful tool. It's legitimate but from my perspective having servedhere having been elected seven times I've never seen a time when it's become sort of standard operating procedure. ...Requiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business.""by Dan Friedman and Megan Scully",0

Therefore, Ibelieved that you shall posess the capability andreliability to cHampion this opportunity with me.In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of 14million US dollars (Fourteen million US dollars), inan account that belongs to one of our foreigncustomers who died along with his entire family inDecember,2002 in a plane crash. Since we got the urglyinformation about his death, we have been expectinghis next of Kin to come over and claim his moneybecause we can not release it unless somebody appliesfor it as next of Kin or relation to the deceased asindicated in our banking and financial policies butunfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kinor relation died along side with him in the accidentleaving no body behind to claim the money.It istherefore upon this discovery that I and otherofficials in my department now decided to makethis business proposal to you and release the money toyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased forsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody iscoming for it and we dont want this money to go intothe Bank treasury as unclaimed bills. The Banking lawand guideline here stipulates that if such moneyremained unclaimed after five years, the money will betransferred  into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for a foreigner as next of kin in thisbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customerwas a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as nextof kin to the deceased family.We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you asforeign partner, in respect to the provision of aforeign account, 5% will be set aside for expensesincurred during this transaction and 75 % would be forme and my colleagues. Thereafter, I and my colleagueswill visit your country for disbursement according tothe percentages indicated.To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to youas arranged above, you must apply first to the Bank asthe relation or next of kin to the deceased indicatingyour private telephone and fax numbers for easy andeffective communication and location wherethe money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by faxor e-mail the text of the application. I will not failto bring to your notice that this transaction is hitchfree and that you should not entertain any atom offear as all required arrangements have been made forthe transfer.You should contact me on my E-MAIL as soon as youreceive this letter. I decided to contact you as wehave products of interest in your part of the worldwhere we can invest our own percentage to avoidpeoples awareness as we are civil servants. With youracceptance and cooperation, we can conclude thisoperation within ten working days.

"    Attn;  I am Dr. zingiwa Micheal,the Director of South African Refugee Camp, a member of Salvation Army Unit Six based in Joberg South Africa.I am oblerged to intimate you with this new development. I have a widow from Sudan recently transfered to our Camp. She lost the husband and three children during the recent trouble in Darfur--Sudan.   She told me that she came into South Africa with huge sum of money at the tune of Fourty Million U.S. Dollars($40million) concelled in a consignment which she deposited with a private Security Company in Pretoria for proper keep and safety and that she wants me to assist her to get a reliable foreign friend who will assist us transfer the huge sum into his or her foreign Bank account abroad for investment purposes. She told me that the money belongs to his Uncle who was at the head of the Sudanese Army and who was killed also during the upheval.  . I remain greatful to get in contact with you and will be pleased if you can grant me the opportunity to work out this transaction with you. I have intoregated the widow and have collected data's that proved her very correct and sincere, but it is very unfortunate that I cannot exhaust the true picture of this proposal through this writing because of its secret nature and therefore, I am of the opinion that for you to be well informed on this, we need to arrange for our person to person meeting in the near future immediately you indicate your willingness to assist and I am assuring you that we can trustfully and unitedly execute this transaction without risk through your cooperation to the benefit of both of us.   I hope that our face to face meeting will surely enhance our relationship and will give us opportun ity to know exactly our percentages when the money is finally transfered or your service charge and also hope you will consider my person and position and reply favourably through my personal e-mail address above.

ICEP is charged with the responsibility ofsourcing for bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swissindigenes, which has been dormant since World War II.It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Bankerï¿½sAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened bynon-Swiss citizens, who were victims of holocaust.These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945).The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts-54,000 in December 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormantaccounts, like interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts,safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, Numbered accounts andnon-interest-bearing transaction accounts.The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims onaccounts due to non-Swiss Citizens.

"Council on Foreign RelationsExpert BriefThe U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts from MythsSteven Dunaway Adjunct Senior Fellow for International EconomicsAuthor:Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Authorof the Council Special Report Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis.November 16 2009http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=Â°/02Fregion%2F271%2FchinaMany myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four in particular stand out andit is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. Thefact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the UnitedStates is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly since China is a major source for U.S.imports U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition the Chinese authorities haveemphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability inChina is bad with adverse implications for the rest of the world.Taken together these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies especially its exchange rate policy to facilitate therebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake and that is why during his trip to AsiaPresident Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes inChina. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit inPittsburgh in September 2009.Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main ""banker"" for the United StatesChina holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves it is estimated that70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt but it is not America's banker. Nor is theUnited States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries there are otherwilling public and private sector buyers as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although theU.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in theevent that the Chinese reduce their demand the increase in interest rates would likely be small.Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on thereason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if Chinareduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greaterflexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance itseconomy and be able to sustain rapid growth.China is a big customer for U.S. debt but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China tofinance its budget deficits.If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate it will build up large additional amounts of officialreserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities then China will increase itspurchases of assets denominated in other currencies with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.In these circumstances China would continue to intervene in its exchange market with the central bank buying U.S.dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be anappreciation of the euro. Consequently countries in Europe not the United States would probably be most affected byChina's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweighthe effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.Alternatively China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of othermajor currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interestrates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However the U.S.Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent marketdisruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur asubstantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss and arevery unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternativeofficial reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goodsThis is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover all of the basic types ofmanufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing textiles footwear toys small appliancesetc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitutefor products from China would be higher but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition amongproducers has become fiercer and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers arenarrowing.Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth inChina is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions the country will struggle to meet thisobjective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. Whileno country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure the truth is that if there is no pressure thereis less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China where the authorities are wedded to the status quobecause of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments inChina's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008 China has reverted tofixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for ChinaChinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effectson China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changesin China. For example concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has beena major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improveconditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment ofmigrant workers). Hence for China instability is not necessarily bad but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability inChina also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although Chinaaccounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth the country does not generate much demand for products fromother countries given China's large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodityproducers may be benefiting from China's strong growth but overall it is not providing much stimulus for the worldeconomy as a whole so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chineseauthorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing theChinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy but this should be done in his private discussionswith China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions such as those in the context of the G-20 process are a much moreeffective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other majoreconomies.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the bestinterest of China because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth towardgreater reliance on consumption China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting Chinato fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the UnitedStates and other major economies.",0

"     Dear One in Christ,  Good day, I am sorry to take your time and to disturb you. I am Mrs Susan Thompson ,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Eric Thompson, who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter (Lilian) who later died in a motor accident.     Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again Christians. Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of (US$4.8 M )(FourMillion,Eight hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. Presently,this money is still with the bank.      Recently,Following my ill health, my Doctor told me that I may not last for the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a  Christain organization (Church) or individual beleiverthat will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein,according to the desire of my latehusband before his death.     I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities like,Orphanages, Christain schools, and Churches for propagating  the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God  is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed is the hand that giveth"". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision.       I am not afraid of death  hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.      I want you and the members of your Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.   Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply.   Remain blessed in the Lord.   Yours in Christ, Mrs Susan Thompson.        ---------------------------------Protect Your PC Now ! -- 0 Yen Security Campaign",1

"URGENT FAMILY ASSISTANCEI am Thiry-Five years old widow (the second wife) of the late President Lurent Kabila of the Republic of Congo. My husband was the former President of D.R.C who was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards on 16th January 2001. At the mid term of this rebellion which is still on in my country, the younger brother of my husband, my son and I went out of Congo according to my husbandï¿½s instruction before his death because the fate of our country was yet to be decided. We came with sealed diplomatic baggage to South Africa. On arrival in South Africa, we sought for political asylum. We were not allowed to operate a Bank Account and I was so scared that I decided to deposit my baggage in a Security Company here in Johannesburg, because I wanted to be on a safer side, I told them that the baggage belongs to my foreign affiliate who is beneficiary of the item. Since then, I have been looking for a reliable and trust worthy person to help me transfer the content of my deposit (USD20, 000.000.00) (Twenty  Million United States Dollars) into a Foreign Account overseas prior to investment in any conducive country.30% of the total sum to you if you assist us in transferring this money to any of your Overseas Account.70% of the total sum will be for the family   investment in any country of which you will be a guide to us.Please should this meet your utmost consideration, contact my son George Kabila through his phone number +27-73-244-79-98 feel free to ask questions you consider necessary. Please include your private telephone and fax numbers for easier communication. The confidentiality of this transaction cannot be over emphasized as we trust and believe that you will oblige us the needed security and attention it demands.Please treat this transaction with absolute confidentiality.",1

"Dearest In Christ, It is with Heavy Heart i am reaching you regarding the death of my late client. I am Barrister Robert Beaud, the legal adviser to late MR. MIKE  & CAROL HALL, a very Wealthy Couple that lived here in the United Kingdom, before their recent Death on the 26th of December during the Tsunami disaster last year (2004).http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4153821.stm) these couple served God as very dedicated Christians,they so dedicated their life to God but they had no child till they died. They acquired a lot of landed properties like lands, Stocks/Bond,house properties, etc. As their legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Mike  & Carol Hall instructed me to write his WILL because they had no child, they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, their assets should be given out to a ministry for the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the documents for the assets that are deposited with the security company are in my care. He gave me the authority to give out the funds to the Ministries for the work of God. As instructed by  MR. MIKE HALL before his death. As a matter of fact the total amount of money that is contained in the two trunk Boxes is $10,000,000.00 ,They did not want the management of the Security Company to know the content of the consignments, therefore they registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security company believes that what They deposited with them were Gold Bars. As a born again Christian,I have been reading my bible and I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before his death.After my fasting and prayers Today, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the chosen ministry that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came across your address on the Internet as I was browsing through a Christian site.I appeal to you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God. I have just notified the Security Company where they deposited the consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad, and the security company is awaiting my authority to move the consignment out of the shores of my country. Dear child of zion, if you know that you will use this fund honestly and wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me with the above mentioned information via (rbeaud14@netscape.net) Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. Yours in Christ. Barrister Robert Beaud. ",1

Here inNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high reputewith years of outstanding service to the people ofAfrica.I have resolved to contact you through thismedium based on business proposal that will be ofmutual benefit to both of us.I got your particulars through a consultant companybase on my research for atrustworthy and establishedperson that understands investment ethic for enteringinto a life time profitable joint partnershipinvestment and also co-operation with confidence andtrust that you willkeep the contents secret anddivulged to any third party.To be explicit and straight to the point. Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of ours depositedaconsignment in our company\'s vault for safekeeping.And since then our client has failed to comeforward to claim his consignment, which hasaccumulated aconsiderable amount of money indemurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact thisclient to redeem the demurrage which his consignmenthad accumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Sincethe death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,none of his benefactors has come forward to claim theconsignment with us, which means that non of hisrelatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment.Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open thetwo boxes that our client deposited in our vault. Andto my surprise I discovered that the two boxes thatwere registered as treasurer by our client actuallycontained a considerable amount of money in UnitedStates Dollars amounting to about US$30 millionDollar. Since this development I have been nursingplans secretly. I also found out from enquiries andthe foreign media that our late client siphoned a lotof money from his country while he was in office ashead of state.It is my conviction that the consignmentin our vault was part of the money that our clientsiphoned and now that he is dead there is no race tothis money in our care.I am now soliciting your nobleassistance to assist me in transferring this money outof nigeria to your country for immediate investmentwith your assistance.I have also decided that you willgenerously been titled to 30% of the total amount.Upon my receiptof your reply confirming yourwillingness to assist me of this transaction, I willimmediately arrange and transfer all the rights ofownership of this consignment to your name tofacilitate your easy clearance and transfer of thecomplete funds to yourcountry.you have nothing to worry about, as I will be thereto assist you in anyway necessary with all properdocumentation.This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintainabsolute confidentiality on this matter.Please reply to the above email address with yourtelephone and fax so can call you.Thanks.Yours faithfully.MR.ISA MUHamEED__________________________________________________________________Get Tiscali Broadband From =A315:99http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadbandhome/",1

"I am MR ALBERT SITHOLI, the Bank Manager of Amalgamated Bank of SouthAfrica {ABSA}. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal foryou. An American Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African SolidGold Corporation, Mr. Glenn Hatleberg made a numbered time (Fixed) Depositfor twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty MillionDollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to hisforwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder andfinally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African SolidGold Corporation that Glenn Hatleberg died in a plane crash in AlaskaAirlines Flight #261 (for more information about this crash and person,you can contact this website:http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, Ifound out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to tracehis next of Kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation anddiscovered that Mr. Glenn Hatleberg did not declare any Kin or relationsin all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in myBank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and theinterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of eachyear. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws ofRepublic of South Africa, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the moneywill revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobodyapplies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to standin as the next of kin to Mr. Glenn Hatleberg so that the fruits of thisold man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt governmentofficials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately yourfull names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessarydocuments and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of Kin. Weshall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization ofthe WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter ofProbate/Administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account inany part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate thetransfer of this money to you as the Beneficiaryext of Kin. The moneywill be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for meand 30% for you, then 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we mayincur during transactions.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will bedone by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees thesuccessful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, pleasereply immediately via the private Fax and Phone numbers below. Upon yourresponse, I shall then provide you with more details and relevantdocuments that will help you understand the transaction. Please send meyour confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Andkindly observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that thistransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shallrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.My private Phone +27-73-400-4485 or Fax +27-11-507-5946.

"Dear Sir,I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.Yours faithfully,Mr. Tambo   ",1

"Dear friend, Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mailand I urge you to treat it serious. However strange or surprising. This contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and the immense benefit it will be to you and I.We want to transfer to overseas account ($3,000.000.00 USD) (Three Million United States Dollars) from a Diamond Bank Ltd here in Senigal,I want to ask you,If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive thismoney, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this importantbusiness trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future. I am Mr Martins Dele, the Auditor General of Diamond Bank here in Senigal. During the course of our auditing, I discovered a floatingfund in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and since 2002 nobody has operated on this account again,after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floatingand if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. Theowner of this account is Mr. FORREST STEPHEN DeMARTINO of Sidney,Ohio United States of America. Who was involved in an {AIR CRASH} that occurred on Jan Thursday 9th 2003 With an air craft {US Airways Express Flight 5481 } which crashed Wednesday at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, killing all 21 aboard passenger. Since the management got the information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or his next of kin to come up and claim his money.Unfortunately, From the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim.The banking and financial law of Diamond Bank stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period of (3-4)Three-four years, it will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. On this discovery, I decided to do businesswith you and release the money to you as the next of kin to Mr. FORREST STEPHEN DeMARTINO for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will soon proceed for my retirement leave this year, and I personally do not want this fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.That is why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement from the banking services this year. The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer Mr. FORREST STEPHEN DeMARTINO was a foreigner and a Senigalise cannot stand as his next of kin or heir.in agreement that 40% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased, indicating your bank account number and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest, I will Guide you on the application that you will send to my Bank authority.This transaction is guaranteed to success withoutany problems.Looking forward to your urgent reply.Regards,Mr Martin Dele- Mr Martin Dele",1

Sir, my message to you is primarily to solicit for your assistance in claiming this item and the fund from the bank of Ghana as my late father""s foreign business partner.               However, you are only to stand or represent my late father""s foreign business partner to enable us claim the item and the fund from the bank of ghana.

Cheryl and HumaAs HRC requested for this weekend attached is a draft base text for the big speech/FA article. I will be on aplane all day Wednesday heading for Asia to do policy planning talks so it would be great to have her feedback either byphone on Monday or meeting with her on Tuesday â€” that way I could turn around another draft by Thursday toresponse to her reactons and then Lissa and I could work on turning it into a real speech draft and circulate morewidely. I will also have plenty of time on my trip to work over a version that would be more suitable for Foreign Affairsassuming she is comfortable with the overall frame and the different pieces.Have a good weekend!AM5,0

"Dear Friend,As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is BATES ALAN a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.God be with you. BATES ALAN",1

There is an account opened in this Firm  in 2002 and since then nobodyhas operated on this account again.

"Dear Good Friend.I am Mrs Joy Williams from Solomon Islands. I am married to Mr. Lobi Williams who worked with our Embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $8.5 Million with a Bank in Cote D lvoire.Presently this money is still in the custody of the Bank in Cote D lvoire.Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church,organization or good person that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.I want a church,organization or good person that will use this fundfor orphanages, widows and other peoples that needs help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that""Blessed is the hand that giveth"".l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband elatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband prperties and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development and l know that With God all things are possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Cote d' lvoire. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want you, church or the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my only shephard.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.Contact me on the this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person, church,organization for this same purpose.Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

FYIFrom Stevens John CSent; Monday April 23 2012 7:00 PMTo; Sullivan Jacob)Cc Cretz Gene A; Fettman JeffreySubject RE: Latest from HRC friendJake- Interesting report. Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinkingand machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadn't heard about ENI-related corruption butwouldn't be surprised.On the federalism issue. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. Acabinet chance won't solve that problem though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters totake on the Bardans. To the contrary it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeidtribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing theirbeloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they aren't alreadydoing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans heldsimilarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentaryelections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection withthose elections and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things hadcalmed down). Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in thecorning months. Of course we and the UN and our other partners should encourage them to do so.- ChrisSBUThis email is UNCLASSIFIEDFrom; Sullivan JacobSent: Monday April 23 2012 5:31 PMTo: Stevens John C; Cr Gene A; Feltman Jeffrey DSubject Latest from HRC friendU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739878Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Let me know your thoughts:SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council as well as the highest levels ofEuropean Governments and Western Intelligence and security services.1.On April 17 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a closeadvisor that he is considering when or even if to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for thegovernment of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership Jalilrealizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technicalexperts. Jaili continues to believe that for the moment the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalistmovement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continuesto complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of noconfidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead according to this source Jalil is consideringdelaying a CiOCISI011 possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual the NTC has been able to reach a temporaryunderstanding with the eastern federalists allowing the separatists to administer their local regions while deferring to theNTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regardingwho has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16 2012no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge and Jalil now believesthey can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular Jalil according to asensitive source is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalistmovement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source el-Keib's future depends on Jalil'sopinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib'scabinet and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused securitysituation in Tripoli. However while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regardingpossible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to theeastern federalists. Unfortunately from Jalil's point of view this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightenedtension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source after reviewing the federalistproblem Dr Abd al-Nasser SHamata the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC believes that el-Keib al Juwali OilMinister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTCindividuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of thissource Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms SHamata told Jalil that for the most part theexisting fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political andtribal leaders. However since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration it isdifficult for firms to initiate new projects since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign suchagreements. SHamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister whoever he is must establish an orderly administrationbefore full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime SHamata warns that his office has foundevidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard he stated that local representatives ofthe Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of thecountry where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans but he believes ENImanagement in Italy is aware of this situation. SHamata pointed out without additional comment that Ben Yezza is along time senior official of ENI.5. In the opinion this source SHamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI at leastuntil they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address hisproblems proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.6. (Source Comment: According to this source el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bringorder to the National Army disarm independent militias and establish security throughout the country. The leadingopposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTCmembers will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are providedby members of this Political committee who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the noconfidence vote however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituentassembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739878Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

"HelloThis letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium.As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation. I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital. Note that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you. ",1

"Good day,    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting youconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under ourbanks management three years ago.I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one isinformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certainfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, thesubject matter; came to our bank to engage in business discussions withour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financialportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have usturn over (invest) on his behalf.In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed tomake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. Hedirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. Iinformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to havethis done and in order not to circumvent due process.Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since theincidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds availableto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure Ifollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the fundsdeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialistprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals andblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertaketransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highlyprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed andwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money wasdeposited with the security firm.The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of hisarrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication wehad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, andwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity ofthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internalinvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. Aperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack inCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify thebody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed nonext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with usmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under aname; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful; weï¿½ve used ourprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of theproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished withyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I wantyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking worldwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. Theworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for thosethat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You shouldhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.There is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, Ialone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no oneunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of thisdeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.",1

On June 6, 1999,an Oil consultant/contractor with Dubai PetroleumCorporation, MR DAVID AMEERALY, made a numbered time(fixed)deposit fortwelve calendar months,Valued at US$16,500, 000.00 (sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. upon maturity I sent a routine =notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from hiscontract employers,the Dubai Petroleum Corporation that MR DAVIDAMEERALY, died in the plane crash On October 31,1999,(an EgyptianBoeing767Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirmit yourself via the websitebelow:http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtmlOn further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILLand attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless . I therefore made further investigation and discovered that MR DAVIDAMEERALY,did not declare any next of kin or relations in all hisofficial documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$16,500, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward =to claim it and according to UNITED ARAB EMIRATES LAW,at the expiration =of(Ten) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the UNITED ARAB =EMIRATES Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to MRDAVID AMEERALY, so that the fruit of this old man labour will not getinto the hands of some corrupt Government officials.This is simple, Iwill like you to provide immediately your full name and address so thatI can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for preparing thenecessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as thenext of kin. Any bank account in any part of the world,which you will provide,willthen facilitate the transfer of this money to you as thebeneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of50% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.There is no risk at all. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and myposition as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution ofthis transaction.If you are interested,please reply immediately and upon your =responses,I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that =will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that thistransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shallrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please upon the receipt of this mail message,send to me the followingbelow to enable me start the processing of the transfer,momoh3333@yahoo.co.ukmomoh4444@yahoo.co.uk1.Your Full Name2.Your House Address.3.Your Phone Number and Fax,Thank You And God Bless You.Sincerely,Mr Momohh  Ngogbee    --06a22670-b966-4bf4-a911-7bd49029f4d7--",1

I am Mr. PRINCE WILL NKOMO , the son of late Mr. HARRY NKOMO, one of the major victims in the on going crisis in Zimbabwe. You might have heard or read about it, you can visit www.cnn.com\zimbabwe. I obtained your contact privately and after due consideration and prayers decided to contact you for assistance to transfer and invest our family fund.My country Zimbabwe is in real war with no end sight, the president Mr. Robert Mugabe  introduced a new land reform act meant to deprive and relocate all the major farms in Zimbabwe, this now resulted in the Zimbabwe war veterans and black mob killing, looting and displacing the entire farm in Zimbabwe, many has been killed and my father was one of the major  victims, as we own one of the biggest farm in our country.Shortly before his death, he took to South Africa with my mother to deposit the sum of US$20,000,000.00(TWENTY  MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) into a security and finance company in South Africa. It was deposited as a family valuables to avoid attention and high demurrage payment because this money was actually for the building of an ultra modern farms with all the machineries such as pipe-born water, electricity chemicals etc. only that he did not survive to realize this, May His Gentle Soul Rest In Peace.Now faced with this situation, we decided to exile to South Africa with the rest of the family where we have awaited for things to cool down and have successful claims to the funds .I have in my mother's possession all the necessary documents as regards to the deposit of this fund.We had planned to invest this money in South Africa, but because of our status as asylum seekers, the financial laws in South Africa does not allow asylum seekers any investment and financial rights not even to operate a bank accounts in the country until asylum is approved which still pending, more so the nearness of South Africa and my country is not safe for us without a reliable bank account into which we can transfer this money. Do understand to provide a suitable account to transfer this fund for our resettlement and investments. Can you handle this fund without any problem in your country, if so do contact me on my telephone no as soon as possible for further arrangement as regards to our working plans.Thanks and God bless as I await your sincerely response.Mr  PRINCE WILL NKOMO(FOR THE FAMILY).",1

"Valenzuela Arturo A <ValenzuelaAA@state.gov>Friday October 1 2010 7:34 AMGonzalez Juan S; Sullivan Jacob J; Abedin Huma; Steinberg James B; Burns William JFrom Arturo - Correa Rescued in EcuadorMadame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting andstriking police and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same the army finally rescued him at9pm last night. Some military units including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. Thepolice also occupied the national congress. As the rescue took place the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefsof Staff issued a statement supporting the president and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law""in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the maximum authority of the three branches."" Things are nowcalm.Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South Americanpresidents at the call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to supportCorrea. Several including Garcia and Santos called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried toreach you at around 6pm last evening to convey that news I took the call.As you know we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish whichwas re-played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for hisgovernment and to wish him well.He will appreciate it but more broadly it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutionalorder and rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we werebehind the unrest. We have prepared a call sheet for you.RegardsArturo",0

"Dear friend,I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Kenneth Mugaji, the first andonly surviving son of late David Mugaji one of the foremost and rich blackfarmers in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.Before the death of my father, he had given me the certificate of depositehe used to deposit the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five HundredUnited State Dollars) in one of the private fudiciary companies in the United=Kingdom,as family valuables, when he realized the looming dangers in =Zimbabwe.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicalsfor the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in land.This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land =reform,which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black =farmers (my father included).This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) andthe unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe's war veterans,under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It isagainst this background that I fled the country with my family, to where we =are currently seeking asylum.I have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the law here prohibits asylum =seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, =hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to =entrustthe above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family's =survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 15% of the totalamount for your assistance or go into partnership for the properinvestment of the money in your country.We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.I await your reply through the above media, while I implore you tomaintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch freetransaction.I shall furnish you with more details on request.Yours truly,Kenneth Mugaji",1

We ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to release these three Americans and allow them to go home and bereunited with their families.###,0

"FROM THE DESK OF  DR. JERRY BERRYTHE MANAGER OF AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPT,BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA-FASO.I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINIONEXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONALINFORMATION AND USE.I am DR. JERRY BERRY the manager of bill and exchange at the foreignremittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$12.5M,(Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You can read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this  business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement  since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money  remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than four years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only  that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabï¿½ cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total  sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email  the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

Eco.docx- 25Nov2010.docThis is a very thoughtful piece that identifies many of the same factors we are in our diplomatic chapter (and that is notjust because the author â€“ the former Bangladesh ambassador to the USâ€”cites me). What is most striking is that itaffirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grapplingwith. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the worldafter the QDDR is in but even if that can't happen we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out toforeign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact.

I am the son of Late General Alexandre Aka Williams the former Director of military inteligence and special acting General Manager of the Sieria Leone Diamond mining coperation (S.L.D.M.C.) I am writing to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest this sum of $9.000,000.dollars in your country belongs to my late father which he inherited during his life time in my country. This money is revenues from solid minirals and Dimonds sale which were under my fathers possession before the civil war broke out. Following the brake out of the war, almost all Government offices,coperations and parastatals were attacked and vandalized.The (S.L.D.M.C) was loothed and burnt down to ashes, and diamonds worth millions of dollars was stolen by the rebel military forces who attacked my fathers office. Many top Government officials and senior Army officers were assasinated and my father was a key target because of his very sensitive military possition and appointment in the (S.L.D.M.C.) regreatable to me, my father was captured and murdered along with my senior brother in cool blood during a mid-night attack and the rebel when our residence in freetown was armbushed by Fordey Sanko the notorious rebel leader. Our mother sustainded very several bullet injuries which resulted to her untimely and painful death in a private hospital here in Ivory Coast. Now we are alone in a totally strange country without parents, relatives or any body to care for us at our tender ages. before our mother died, she told me that my father deposited a hung amount which he made from diamond sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that we should pray and find a trustworthy foreign business partner who would help us to transfer and invest this money in profitable business venture overseas. Mother also advice me to act quickly so that we can leave Ivory Coast with our cousin brother-Arthur who is here in the camp withe us,and then settle down abroad for the rest of our life.She also gave me all the deposit documents to claim the money and then told me that my father used my name as the only son to deposit the money in the bank,and also advice me that this is the reason why we came to Ivory Coast. My mother died after her advice to me May her spirit rest In perfect peace. Furthermore, I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this deposit and I spoke with the director of International remittance who assured me that verything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money to my foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide the bank account informations. However, the director is very concerned because of our sitaution here, I am 17 years and as such promised to help me and he would like to speak with my partner to ensure that this money is invested wisely in only profitable business because of his personal interest and sympathy for my family. Please note that I will offer you 15% of the total money as compensation for your noble assistance in accordiance with my mothers advise.I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which you consider very good in your country and you would also get a school for me and my little sister and my cousin so that we can finish our education. I am hoping to hear from you so that i will give you more details information. Upon the confirmation of this money into your account we will fly immediately to your country to meet with you for onward investment according to my mother's advice.Thanks.

"AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarksBy: Associated PressNovember 21 2012 07:03 PM ESTU.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya andthree other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subjectto review and updates.She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who has been critical of her but said ""some of the statements he'smade about me have been unfounded but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discussall of this with him.""Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widelydenounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.11 2001 terror attacks on the United States and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place onthe anniversary.The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President BarackObama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton who is not expected to stay on during his second term.Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: ""As a senior U.S. diplomat I agreed to a White House request toappear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day which at that time wereprimarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities Americandiplomatic facilities around the world and Iran's nuclear program.""Hours before the Benghazi violence a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-Islamic blasphemy.

"Sir,Compliment of the day and how is life general withyou? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit andcrave your indulgence to make this project request fora joint business transaction which I hope will notcome to you as a surprise, hence I plead foryour pardon.I am Dr.Sam Jordan, the  Manager of headquarterFirst Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent andconfidentialbusiness proposal for you. On June 6, 1998, an Italian oilconsultant/contractor with via National Petroleumcooperation (NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time(fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued atUS$43.7,000.00 in my branch.On maturity, I sent a routine notification to hisforwarded address but got no reply after months wesend a reminder and finally we discovered from hiscontract employee (Nigeria national petroleumCorporation) that Mr. Paul Bush died from anautomobile accident. On further investigation, it wasclear  that he died without making a will. Allattempts by the Australian to trace his next ofkin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discoveredthat Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin orrelations in all his official documents including hisdeposit document in my bank. The total sumUS$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormantacct.No one will ever come forward to claim it. Accordingto Nigerian banking law, after five years, the moneywill revert to the ownership of the NigerianGovernment. If the account owner is certified deathand nobody comes forward to claim it.This is the situation , and my proposal is that I amlooking for a foreigner who will stand in as thebeneficiaryext of kin. This is simple. All you haveto do is to immediately send me the details of a bankaccount anywhere in the world for me to arrange theproper money transfer document. The money will then betransferred into the account for us to share in theration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining10% will be set aside for expenses incurred withhere and there.There is no risk involved. I am using my position andconnection in the bank here to do all the documentwork for the transaction. We shall employ the servicesof an attorney to draft the will and obtain allnecessary documents and letter of administration inyour fovour for the transfer. This transaction is riskfree guaranteed. If you are interested, please replyimmediately confidentiality and be rest assured thatthis transaction could be most profitable for both ofus. Please do not expose this deal if you are notinterested because if you do, it will take me outof seat.Please expenses is involve in thisbusiness,phone/fax number,and your bank particulars.I am awaiting your urgent reply.Best regards,Dr.Sam Jordan.",1

When I was searching for a reliable individual or private company that can assist me to transfer a reasonable amount in a safe account abroad on behalf of my late husband, two sons and two daughters. I decided to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of US $20 Million (Twenty Million, United States Dollars)inherited from my late husband in to your personal companyâ€™s account or private account.Before his death, he was a Brigadier in charge of arms and ammunition procurement for the (DRC) army. In his WILL?he specifically draws my attention to this US$ 20 Million which he deposited in a safe box in Private Security Company in South Africa. Â During the war, he was very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until when he found out that some Senior Army Officers and Government Functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties and sending them toforeign countries. Due to this, he and his former special advisers to the president were assigned by the President (Laurent Kabila) to purchase arms in South Africa, they saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and divided it and he got a total sum of US $20 Million. He deposited the box in my sonâ€™s name and him alone with the deposit code canclaim it.I will be grateful if you can assist us now. I want you to do for us as an international partner to help us transfer this money which is in a safety box in the Security Company using your name as the beneficiary ofthis sum. You can contact Â me or my son (George Yangani) Â inSouth Africa on Â this number+27 8046828612. Then, we will tell you more details about it. We are in position to inform you of the whole procedures mapped out of the transfer of this money.We have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% for any expenses that might occur from both sides in the course of this transaction,while the remaining 70% will be for my son's investment, which you will assist him to do abroad.Further information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust, confidence and good relationship will be established and safety of this fund assured when transferred to your account.Please treat this matter with utmost urgency.May Allah (God) bless you as I earnestly hope for yourassistance.

"As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry forme, because, I believe everyone will die someday.My name is MRS WU YUNG a merchant SENTOSA in SINDAPORE,I have been diagnosed with Esophagealcancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right nowI have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. Ihave not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared foranyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was nevergenerous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on mybusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as Inow know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make allthe money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance tocome to this  world I would live my life a different way from how Ihave lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given mostof my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members aswell as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me andaccept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, asI want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, Ihave distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeriaand Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of myaccounts and distribute the money which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to becontended with whatI have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of  eighteen million united states dollars that I havewith a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collectthis deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside twenty percent for you and for yourtime.God be with you.regardsMRS WU YUNG",1

"FROM THE DESK OF  PATRICE KONE (Esq).THE MANAGER IN CHARGE OF AUDITINGAND ACCOUNTING UNIT FOREIGNREMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OFDEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)OUAGA-BURKINA FASO IN WEST AFRICA.PLANE CRASH WEB SITE..http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm                        (""REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS                          &nbs p;  CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE"")Compliment Of The Season,On a very good day. I am (PATRICE KONE  Esq),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to cHampion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we donï¿½t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of y=our integrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to see=k for foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laur=ent Nkono, the first son of&nbsp; Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular bla=ck farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my c=ountry.</DIV><DIV>This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe int=roduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and s=ome few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Z=imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of p=eople were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was o=ne of the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fl=ed Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherla=nds where we are seeking political asylum.</DIV><DIV>Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to depo=sit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United S=tates dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the l=ooming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones t=o avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the= purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of =new farms in Swaziland. <BR>Now the family have decided to transfer my fath=er's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands= prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be invo=lved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Nether=lands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility= of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred= without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything w=e have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with the=m hence I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of S=outh Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future and as =you are aware both countries have similar political history. As a businessm=an, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of =my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk f=ree.

Firstly you can choose to h=ave your percentage of the money immediately after the funds hit your accou=nt, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable invest=ment of the money in your country.

I am really sure that youwill be of agood assistance after going thoroughly through this letter.For many years of marriage now between me and my husband, Ihavenot given birth, and this has really troubled my husband.As a result of the respect given to local tradition culture and customhere in Nigeria,my husband has decided to break the marriage. Withthe situation of thingswith me now, my matrimonial home look bleak. I am beenthreatened dailyby my husband to get out from the home. My Husband sbrothers are notleft outin this matter. This situation has really affected me psychologically.As at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,hence I seekyour urgent assistance and help which I know will go a longway in getting me settled finally.I want to use this opportunity to move the sum of(US$29.5M) intoyour custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in yourcountry. Thissaid amount was given to my husband as gratification fromsome Foreign OilCompanies he helped in getting Allocation for the Drillingof Crude Oilin Nigeria.As a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hencehegave me this money to keep in my personal account so thathe can beexonerated from the eyes of government security operativesand the Civil Service Commission (CSC) which is a body thatscrutinizes the activities of allcivil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances forofficialmisconduct. Be informed that this money is not connectedwith drugs; money laundry,firearms and looting which I believe will put fears in youto render the required assistance needed from you and consequentlywithdrawing your help forsecurity reasons.Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear.This money was deposited in my personalin name, andthere is no way it can be transferred telegraphically underthe bankingprocedures which could have been the easiest, but becauseof monetarytransfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,that isdefeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to movethis money out in cash to anydestination where it will be easy for you to collect underdiplomaticimmunity.This he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your responseandwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish youon the next line ofacti onto take, but be rest assured that this transactionis 100% risk free,and my husband will not raise any alarm because he will notlike to puthimself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, hestands thechange of loosing his job.As soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm tomethat you have received it, I will be coming to meet you upthere in your country where I wish to live the rest of my life. Iwill be offering you 25% of this money for all your help at this time ofneed, while somepercentages has been  set aside for my Brother tocomplement his efforts here. Beinformed that this transaction will not last more than 14working daysand it will be concluded because every arrangement has beenput in place.Your negative or positive response will be highlyappreciated.Yours faithfully,Mrs. Rose Obaseki ___________________________________________ Look Good, Feel Good www.healthiest.co.za",1

"OPINION DECEMBER 7 2010New Start: Ratify With CaveatsThe treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces but senators should make it clear toMoscow that they don't see it as limiting U.S. missile defenses.By CONDOLEEZZA RICEWhen U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002 they addressed the nuclearthreat by reducing offensive weapons-as their predecessors had. But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in thewake of America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and for the first time the United Statesand Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishmentof a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The realthreat was that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world's most dangerousregimesâ€”or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states alsopursued ballistic missiles defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United Statesand our allies.It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security.The treaty is modest reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1550 on each sideâ€”more than enough for deterrence.While the treaty puts limits on launchers U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain atriad of bombers submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover the treaty helpfullyreinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty lastyear.Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush and itsreinstatement is crucial.Still there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and if thetreaty is ratified in future monitoring of the Obama administration's commitments.First smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona hasled a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department ofEnergy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments and Congress should fullyfund the president's program.Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defensestrategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser StephenHadley.Second the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold Warlink between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard as it recognizes the""interrelationship"" of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link and that the treaty will notlimit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this.Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remainfully free to explore and then deploy the best defensesâ€”not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing bothpotential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases.I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russiansneed to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability tointercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by ourmissile defenses. In addition the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recentlybetween NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field.After all a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States but to international stability broadly.Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in theKremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terroristsâ€”some who operate in Russia's unstable southâ€”are dangerous.That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat fromtactical nuclear weapons which are smaller and more dispersed and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russiaknows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is not in itsinterest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran and itslongstanding concern about Pyongyang.The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for along time.After this treaty our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferatorsâ€”not on further reductions in the U.S. andRussian strategic arsenals which are really no threat to each other or to international stability.A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclearsecurity (and that of our allies) going forward. With the right commitments and understandings ratification of the NewStart treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record ofratification New Start deserves bipartisan support whether in the lame-duck session or next year.Ms. Rice a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at Stanford'sHoover Institution was U.S. national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 and U.S. secretary of state from 2005 to 2009.",0

Early last year there was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities homeless.The contract was handled by a foreign firm but because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been completed and the original contractor has since been paid,but the contract balance of US$38 million,which resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my partners are planning to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount into your account.

"of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off theradar for several years returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrollingeveryone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s even the Church of Latter-Day Saintsdistanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappearedentirely had Beck not revived it turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchikobserved in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the TeaParty """"suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.""""The descentBesides influencing Beck Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassrootscelebrities retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery Alabama.On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck Mack recalled with reverence hismentorship by Skousen who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged hisspellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. """"If you control the food supply"""" Mack warned """"you control thepeople. And that's the first step to slavery.""""Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady HandgunViolence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers Mackreemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel Mack helped form a self-styled TeaParty militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism the Oathkeepers solemnly swore torefuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.Because the group's members trained for combat the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.Besides Mack the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-establishedfigure was Mike Vanderboegh a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy andTactics fora Militia Civil War calling for sniper attacks on """"war criminals secret policemen rats."""" With Obama in officeVandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts bycashing in the $1300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda it was a Democrat who posed thegreatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since1993 placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reformwas introduced in Congress Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats making him thede facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensurethat the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops Stupak went a step further. Heintroduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insuranceplans. The amendment which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate became a key sticking point inhealthcare negotiations. """"He's a big hero now in the pro-life community"""" Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser toGeorge W Bush - told me in November 2009. """"Thanks to him this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democratshaving any power.""""To the chagrin of the Republicans Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According toHudson the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass but only if the bill contained a clear provisionforbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally in March 2010 after pressure from Nancy PelosiObama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now heand his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reportsseeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned outvirulent denunciations of Stupak calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens ofdiatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: """"Bart the Baby-Killer.""""On 20 March 2010 thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation ofObama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis a hero of thecivil-rights movement and Representative Barney Frank the first openly gay member of Congress passed through thecrowd on their way inside the Capitol. """"Nigger!"""" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a """"faggot"""" elicitinglaughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile as another African-American Democrat Representative EmanuelCleaver ascended the Capitol steps a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.With the demonstration carried on into the night cries of """"Kill the bill!"""" drifted into calls for violence. """"I would gladly standwith any of you men here and take these fascists down"""" a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front ofan amateur videographer pointing toward the Capitol. """"You haven't heard the last of me!""""The next day Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. Thedemonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally after hours of impassioned speeches on the Housefloor the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.Republican Representative Joe Pitts an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment demandeda motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. Inresponse Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. """"The motion to commit doesnot support life"""" Stupak declared. """"It is the Democrats who have stood up...."""" Heckling from the Republican sideinterrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House cHamber Representative Randy Neugebauer a right-wingRepublican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement began shouting at him from the backbench """"Babykiller!"""" Other Republicans joined in parroting base insults.While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for aright-wing Kristallnacht. """"If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear break their windows""""Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. """"Break them NOW. Break them andrun to break again."""" Within three days windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York Kansas andArizona had been shattered.Meanwhile at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxedto the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn an African-American congressman from South Carolina. RepresentativeAnthony Weiner an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform received a menacing letter filled with white powder.The brother of Representative Tom Perriello another healthcare supporter had his home gas line deliberately sabotagedafter a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouragedactivists to """"drop by"""" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson Arizona the windows of DemocraticRepresentative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through thewindow of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniperattacks.After the passage of the healthcare bill the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.Crusading to restore a holy social order they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy they smashed windowsof elected representatives. Warning of death panels they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violencethickening Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: """"Don't Retreat Instead-RELOAD!"""" Thus concluded thefirst phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.""",0

"<html><body>""How to turn ï¿½3 into ï¿½10,000"" <br>This is not a get rich quick scheme, but with a little effort will make a nice little return - perhaps pay off that credit card after the Xmas spend, or pay for that much needed holiday<br><br>Please take the time to read the following information, which I received recently.<br> <br>Please try not to be sceptical about this program and at least think about it for a few days, otherwise you could be throwing away over ï¿½10,000 in cash! This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people, who joined, have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and just ï¿½3.00 (ï¿½5/$5.00).<br><br>In March of 2003, I received a short and simple e-mail telling me how to make over ï¿½10,000 at a time. Of course I ignored it, but I didn't delete the mail, as there was something about it which rang true and I was keen to know if it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short space of time. I was at that time getting deep in debt. I finally realized that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offered to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn't stop myself from thinking ""What if it actually works?"" For the sake of ï¿½3 isn't it worth a go!<br>I put my doubts to one side, went ahead and followed the simple instructions given in that email. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete and it cost me no more than ï¿½3 (ï¿½5/$5). <br><br>What did it say in that email? Well, if you'll read on, all will be revealed! <br>The business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every single time. I've never made less than ï¿½10,000 from it on each occasion. Let me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything. It does not require you to speak to your friends, family or anybody else (unless you want to). <br>This must sound like an outrageous claim, particularly if you've never had possession of this sort of money before, but believe me, this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By following the simple 3-step plan set out below, within a few short weeks your life could be transformed beyond all recognition! <br><br>Please do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial success. <br><br>This program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days, it required a lot more time and effort, as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However, thanks to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And what's more, the entire process is FASTER, EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! <br>This program works no matter what country you are in, or what currency you use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't need to run a website, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or send out letters through the mail, or pay for advertising, etc. <br><br>You will need:<br>ï¿½	An email address <br>ï¿½	A Premier or Business PayPal account with at least ï¿½3 (ï¿½5/$5) deposited in it <br>ï¿½	30 minutes of your time <br><br>PayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online that anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account, you can send and receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! However, please read further before you visit their website. <br><br>To get started, follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days! <br><br>",1

"EMAIL:aichakone2222@yahoo.co.ukABIDJAN COTE D IVOIRE  Hello, Good day to you the complement of today. i am happy to request for your assistance and also  to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you. I am Miss Aicha Kone,22 years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA KONE. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten million  United State Dollars.(USD$10 million) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.  I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-  1. Can I completely trust you? 2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?  Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you so much.  My sincere regards,  MIss Aicha koneSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com ",1

"I know you will be surprised to read from me, but  please consider this as arequest from a family in dire need of assistance.First, I must introducemyself I am MR. TSEPO VUSI from Angola. I am the first and only son of BRIGADIER VUSI  JONES. I  am presently resident in South Africa.I got your contact address from a business directory  in JohannesburgCHamber of commerce and Industry. On  behalf of my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETHVUSI I  desided to solicit for your assistance to transfer  the sum of US$21.5MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)inheritedfrom my late father, into your personal company's account.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in  charge of Arms andAmmunation procurement for the Angola  Army. In his WILL, he specificallydrew my attention  to the said sum of money which he deposited in a  safe box ofa private Security Company in Johannesburg-  South Africa in a treasure box,fully documented in  my name.IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE  MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOURATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITYCOMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATEDAND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITHGOVERNMENT FUNDS AND  PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUETO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNEDBY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THISAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUMOF US$21.5 MILLION. IN  CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATHONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENT  PURPOSES.>From the above, you will understand that the lives  and future of my familydepens on this money, as such I  will be grateful if you can assist us. We are nowliving in South Africa as political Asylum seekers and financial laws andregulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to suchhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hencei am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set asidefor local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once wehave established  trust and confidence between ourselves. Please treat thismatter as very urgent.Best regards,TSEPO VUSI",1

"FROM:MR MORGAN WIMPOE,105 2ND AVE. SANDTON, 1892,JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.PHONE+27 78 7634400ATTN:MD/C.E.O,  Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Althoughwe never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are ahighly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced yourprofile from a human resource profile database on your country.Though, Ido not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragilepolitical situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines inthe CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr.Morgan Yormie Wimpoe , fromLiberia, a Country in West Africa. My Father Mr John  Yormie  Wimpoe former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My  Father  wasfalsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA(CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him.you can verify this from these international newspaper website below:  (i) http://www.usatoday.comews/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm  Before he was killed, my Father instructed me to escape with my familyto a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG, SOUTH AFRICA, and he confided in me thathe left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (namewithheld for security reasons) . All i require from you is to assist mein claiming the fund (sealed in diplomatic consignment) from securitycompany and invest in your country. When you claim the fund, i shallcome over to your country with my Family so that we can start a new lifeIf you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance  or why can't i takethe cash transfer by  myself? The answer is that there  was an exclusionclause in the original agreement between the company and my father which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can haveaccess to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferredto a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent anyseizure or infiltration of the fund.  My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to mypresent social status and total ignorance of the business world. Ibelieve you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you byplacing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to requestthat you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way.  On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you.In as much as youfollow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guaranteeof a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted theDiplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth$32,Million,(Thirty two million United State Dollars Only). You will begiven 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will bewilling to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. Iwant to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a riskfree transaction.  Kindly include your Full names, Private Telephone and Fax numbers whereyou can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enableme send some other important information across to you. This proposal ishighly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transactionrequiring trust and Confidentiality.

"Dear friend, l am Dr Mallam Galadima., the contracts verification manager of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Because of my position and that of other strategic officials who are heads in their Departments, we have in our possession, since 2001 the sum of US$400M Dolllars (Four hundred million United States Dollars) which we emassed through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully executed and commissioned with the different foreign contractors duely paid their full contract amounts.We have made several fruitless moves to transfer this fund abroad for our mutual benefits. One in 2002 when one Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States of America, living at No 125 N. Kinsley Ave. Ocean City, NJ 082216, ran away with our US$65M Dollars after the fund has been transfered into his account. lt was unbelievable, shocking and hypertensive that when we went there to claim our share of the fund, we were told that nobody with that name was living in that house and that the former occupant of the flat moved away few weeks ago to an unkown house. This is how we lost US$65M Dollars to the heartless Mr. Lambert Brown. The second attempt was when in 2003, we decided to carry US$50M dollars in cash through the Lagos lnternational Airport but was stopped by the Nigerian Custom Officers who seized the fund till date . This is how we lost another US$50M Dollars to the Nigerian Custom. Following the peaceful life ushered in by the current democratic dispensation in Nigeria, l and my colleages have decided to transfer the sum of US$22M (Twenty Two Million dollars) into a foreign account operated by a foreigner for our mutual benefits. By this letter, l request your assistance in transferring and safeguarding the sum of US$22M Dollars for our mutual benefits. For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum 5% will be set aside for charity and philantropic purposes 57% belongs to me and my colleagues while 3% will go for reimbursement of all expenses made by both parties. However, l want you to be human and humane so that you do not become this second Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States. lt is imperative to note that this transaction is risk free as all modalities for the successful transfer of this fund have been perfected by my colleagues in the relevant ministries. However, we should see absolute confidentiality as our watchword throughout the course of this transaction for we are civil servants and will equally not like the 2002 event to redramatise itself. l will not be ungrateful if you can urgently furnish me with your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers and name of beneficiary with the telex numbers of the receiving bank. These will enable us speed up the claim of the fund and eventual transfer into your nominated account. Please reply via this alternative email address:mallamgaladima59@yahoo.com Looking forward to hear from you soonest. Dr.Mallam Galadima",1

"Universal Trust Bank.website:www.utbplc.comDear friend,This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. The message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies. In writing you this message, I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any embarrassment.  I am Mr. Charles Nwodo Manager with Universal Trust Bank  Plc. of Nigeria, Island Branch. I managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself. Time is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business. A British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on January 6, 1999, valued at US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars), for twelve (12) calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian Best died in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$2,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below; charlesnwodo@dr.com. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address .Thanks and regards. Mr. Charles Nwodo.",1

"CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.LAGOS, NIGERIAGOOD DAY FRIENDATTENTION:SIR/MADAMI am MR.VICTOR KOVIS, the Director of OperationsCHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here inNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high reputewith years of outstanding service to the people ofAfrica.I have resolved to contact you through this mediumbased on business proposal that will be of mutualbenefit to both of us. I got your particulars througha consultant company base on my research for atrustworthy and established person that understandsinvestment ethic for entering into a life timeprofitable joint partnership investment and alsoco-operation with confidence and trust that you willkeep the contents secret and divulged to any thirdparty.To be explicit and straight to the point. Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of o! urs deposited aconsignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.And since then our client has failed to come forwardto claim his consignment, which has accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this client toredeem the demurrage which his consignment hadaccumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since the death of our client President MobutouSeseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward toclaim the consignment with us, which means that non ofhis relatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided tosecretly open the two boxes that our client depositedin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that thetwo boxes that were registered as treasure! r by ourclient actually contained a considerable amount ofmoney in United States Dollars amounting to aboutUS$30 million Dollar. Since this development I havebeen nursing plans secretly. I also found out fromenquiries and the foreign media that our late clientsiphoned a lot of money from his country while he wasin office as head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment in our vaultwas part of the money that our client siphoned and nowthat he is dead there is no race to this money in ourcare.I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist mein transferring this money out of nigeria to yourcountry for immediate investment with your assistance.I have also decided that you will generously beentitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receiptof your reply confirming your willingness to assist meof this transaction, I will immediately arrange andtransfer all the rights of ownership of thisconsignment toyour name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of thecomplete funds to yourcountry.you have nothing to worry about, as I will be thereto assist you in anyway necessary with all properdocumentation.This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintain absolute confidentiality on thismatter.Please reply to the above email address with yourtelephone and fax so that i can call you.Thanks.Yours faithfully.MR.VICTOR KOVIS-------------------------------------------------sent by Excite Inbox - http://inbox.excite.co.ukpowered by Excite UK - http://www.excite.co.uk",1

">From Mr.Joseph Cabutti20 SILVER CRESCENT,Enugu,Nigeria.Compliment of the dayI am Joseph Cabutti the consulting auditor with one of the prime banks herein Nigeria.

I am writing you this letter toask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.The propositionAn industrialist and a foreigner who was customer of my client bank, whodied on the 25TH JULY, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] withthe whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing discoveredan account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST whodied without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since hisdeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get anyrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no onehas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this accountor anything concerning it.The account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO ofhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00USD {Thirty six million united states dollars} which the bank now expectsa next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made toget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because ofthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kinand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairmanand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangementfor the funds to be declared ""UNCLAIMED"" and will be lost to the FederalGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms andAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa. In order toavert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have youstand as a next of kin to late beneficiary so that the funds USD36m wouldbe released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. Wewish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and uponsuccessful transaction without any disappointment from your side; we shallre-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whomI must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents whichwould substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth andsuccessful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you aregoing to nominate. On this note, We have secured from the probate an orderof mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiary and more so we areassuring you this business is 100% risk free involvement you should notentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalizedwithin 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiaryof the fund from the deceased. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% ofthe fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum,10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5%will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during thetransfer process.If this proposal is acceptable by you do not make undue advantage of thetrust we have bestowed on you, then kindly get to me immediately.Please furnish me with your private Telephone and Fax Number for easy andsafe communication.Respectfully yours,Joseph Cabutti.",1

Or already in NY? Pis call me when you can. Thx.,0
Your fans are here by the hundreds and eagerly awaiting your speech on the 12th!As you know the US has been a strong supporter of a new women's agency at the UN that would provide for an UnderSecretary General for women's issues better coordination and effectiveness and-- consolidation of a group of smallerentities. In bilats today I learned that some G77 countries are wondering what's in it for them. They're not developingcountries and they're not the UK or US. Brazil may be second guessing the creation of the new agency yet this is anagency that will benefit women everywhere. I don't know if you'll have an opportunity to say to Brazil's leader that wehope the UN women's agency will continue to have their support. In fact Tom Shannon told me that they're reallyinterested in women's issues and wanted to sign a MOU with us. Sometimes there's a disconnect between NY perm repsand their capitals2nd I don't know if you're still going to Chile. If you talk to Bachelet about her future you can tell that so many govt repsat the UN would like to see her head up the new women's agency. It's not clear if she's even interested.Thx,0

"Hello dearFrom, Miss ZACHI MedineAbidjan Cote d'Ivoire West Africa.Hello Dear Chosen one, Please excuse me for all the inconveniences my mail could cause you.I saw your profile and have the intrest on you . Please  even if we never knew before, I believe firmly that on the basis of the right of humanitarian assistance that a real confidence and love can arise from our communication and  also a real partnership between  us. I am Miss Medine ZACHI , the legitimate daughter of the Director of cocoa export here murdered by the rebelles here because of the political crisis going on here since four years ago. My father had deposited a consignment  with a  security company here  containing the sum of  $9.000,000 USD (Nine million dollars USD) To allow him to conceive a project of investment at the end of his mandate here. Regrettably the fate decided on it otherwise. Today my major concern  is to move out  this sum outside here. Given that I am the only child and I have seriously suffered from the raggings and the harassments on behalf of the political opponents of my Father.It is in this prospect that I contact you  to please help me  to move this heritage  from the security company to your country.Because of the political war and the hostilities in this country  I seriously wish to leave from here and  live the rest of my life in a more peaceful and politically more stable and quiet country. It is  what justifies  this demand. I shall voluntarily agree on a good and appropriate percentage of this money as your compensation for your assistant as for what precedes. I would like to count on your human, virtuous and professional qualities. I look forward to recive your urgent responds.Thanks for your care .Yours sincerelyMiss Medine",1

Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces the Libyan Army troops have begun to desertto the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyansin an effort to encourage additional defections.(Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence one rebel commander stated that his troops continue tosummarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzuâ€¢has reportedly joined the rebel command structure in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar wasthe commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA) a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based inN'djamena Chad until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of1990 with the assistance of Libyan and French troops. Haftar and his troops lied to a cotaatry in central Africaand many including Haftar later settled in the United States.)An extremely sensitive source added that the rebels are receiving direct assistance and training from a smallnumber of Egyptian Special Forces units while French and British Special Operations troops are working out ofbases in Egypt along the Libyan border. These troops are overseeing the transfer of weapons and supplies tothe rebels.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739594Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.(Source Comment: The rebels are moving back into 'areas that they lost in mid- March fighting and using theallied air cover they are confident they can move into the Tripoli district in a matter of days. One rebel sourcereported that they had reliable intelligence that people were evacuating Qaddafi's hometown Sirte anticipatingits capture by the rebels. Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be apsychological blow for Qaddall.)Separately a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate acomplete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers whohave experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyantroops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.This source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain but there arereports of deaths among some Qaddafi's senior security officials including Mansour Daw and that the Libyanleader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately the European Intelligence services havebeen unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for FrenchPresident Nicolas Sarkozy who according to knowledgeable individuals is pressing to have France emergefrom this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.Sarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan FightingGroups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.Accordingly he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel Syria and other B6nations in the Middle East to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terroristgroups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of theMuslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.These sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the followingrebel figures in Benghazi:MESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi's former head of protocol who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyanleaders most loyal follower. Noun currently lives in France;.Gehan (GI-LEI-LAND Abdallah (colonel);CHARRA.NT FarajBOUKHRIS FathiGeneral Abdelfateh Younis (commander of the rebel forces)(Source Comment: Senior European security officials caution that AQIM is watching developments in Libyaand elements of that organization have been in touch with tribes in the southeastern part of the country. Theseofficials are concerned that in a post-Qaddafi Libya France and other western European countries must movequickly to ensure that the new government does not allow AQUA and others to set up small semi- autonomouslocal entitiesâ€”or ""Caliphates""â€”in the oil and gas producing regions of southeastern Libya.)These knowledgeable sources add that the insurgents have the following weapons stockpiled in Benghazi:82 and 120 mm. mortars;GPZ type machine guns;12.7mm. machine guns mounted on 4x4 vehicles;some anti-aircraft batteries type ZSU 23/2 and 23/4 as well as Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems(MANPADS) type SAM?;some tanks type T-72;U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739594Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

"Office of Auditor General,CITIBANK,364 Kensington High StLondon W14 8NSDear Friend,I am Dr. Robin Quest the Chief auditor general of CITIBANK 364 Kensington High St London W14 8NS. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On May 20, 1999, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the BRITISH PETROLUEM CORPORATION Mr. Dara Baraz. Made a numbered time (Fixed deposit) for 24 calendar months, valued at US$32,200,000.00 (Thirty two Million two hundred thousand dollars only) in this bank. Upon maturity in 2001, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the British petroleum corporation that Mr. Dara Baraz died as a result of torture in the hand of Sadam Hussein during one of his trips to his country Iraq. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr Dara Baraz did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$32,200,000.00 has been floating as unclaimed since 1999 in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives have hit the stones. According to the British law at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund and the six years is the end of September 2005 Consequently, my proposal is that i want to seek your consent as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money as the next of kin to the deceased so that the bank will transfer the money to your desi gnated account. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out. I have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more so I are assuring you that the business is risk free involvement. Your share stays while the rest be for me and for investment purpose as I will leave London by the end of the year. The sharing of the funds will be based According to agreement within you and me. As soon as i receive an acknowledgement of receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business proposal, I will furnish you with the necessary modalities and disbursement ratio to suit both parties without any conflict. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust i have bestowed in you.PLEASE, APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT DOING BUSINESS OVER THE INTERNET IS RISK. ENDEAVOR TO SEND YOUR CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER INYOUR REPLY TO THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION.Regards.Dr. Robin QuestAuditor Citibank London",1

"Dear FriendThis letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a =day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.

On =November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON =PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 =calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred =Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer =before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as =his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him =on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding =address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum =Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his =country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=92s family wife and =two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not =declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including =his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under =dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard =from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation =I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one =that have the information.With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By =end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which =will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =$5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for =terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country =immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to =late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as =Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of =the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, =with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. =All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and =there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under =a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =U. A. E is porous and anything goes.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are =interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over =the details. Thanking you in advance and may Allah bless youPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality.

Good. What is latest re Sid Blumenthal?,0
Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) hehas clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcryfrom his fathers loyalists.,0

"      SEEKING FOR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION  Zimbabwe formerly Rhodesia under the colonial rule gained independence in 1981 under the nationalist struggle for independence led by Mr. Robert Mugabe and late Joshua Nkomo. Under the white rule and since independence the minority whites that owned most of the farmlands in Zimbabwe have dominated agriculture. The aborigines believe that they are still slaves in their own land if they continue to work the lands for their whites masters even after independence. Robert Mugabe as the black Moses who led his people to freedom has vowed to revoke ownership of the white owned farms and redistribute the lands to the landless blacks. This move he said is necessary to redress the imbalance of the colonial era. For the struggle for freedom, to affect this initiative the government has amended its land acquisition laws and policies last few months, which gave about 3000 white Zimbabwean farmers a 45-day quit notice to leave their lands to the government.  My family and I are caught up in this web of land politics, which also led to the death of our father. We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in sHambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland, a neighbouring country, where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis, every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer.  With a capital base of US$25.5Million, there is a great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of Zimbabwe and South Africa. We are therefore contacting you so you can use a magnificent business technique to transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa. This money is presently deposited confidentially with A security Company here in South Africa. We mapped out 25% of the gross sum as due commission for your expected honest assistance in executing the successful transfer of this money out of South Africa, for our family investments. Please, email us immediately if you are interested, so we can discuss further while we hold this correspondence in the strictest confidence.  Thanks and God bless you. Yours truly, Evan Smith",1

Thefirst two paragraphs are the most important completely accurate in assessment the rest twaddle:1:1Monday Oct. 112010Why Obama Is Losing the Political WarBy Mark HalperinBarack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above by elite opinion about his competence. From below bymass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until afterNovember's elections.With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists most politically engaged elites have reached the sameconclusions: the White House is in over its head isolated insular arrogant and clueless about how to get along with orpersuade members of Congress the media the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by FoxNews pundits executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets reporters who cover the White House Democraticand Republican congressional leaders and governors many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised bigmoney for Obama in 2008 and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama'stroubled first year issue by issue.)On Friday after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data â€” the last major jobs figures before the midterms â€”Obama said ""Putting the American people back to work expanding opportunity rebuilding the economic security of themiddle class is the moral and national challenge of our time."" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challengeand are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover there is a growing perception thatObama's decisions are causing harm â€” that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and thateconomic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy health care deficits housingimmigration and spending.And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turnthings around especially but not exclusively those inclined to dislike him â€” Tea Partyers and John McCain voters butalso tens of millions of middle-class Americans including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how someAmericans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portmanthe Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at aDayton career fair says starkly ""There are no jobs."" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration ""I've beenlooking for a job now for 13 months."" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time thebreadlines for the Obama years.Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration tostave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposalsbased on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own nor offeredgenuine compromise while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism withoutfurnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned theeconomy around but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract fromthe problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in aclear optimistic fashion defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and theTroubled Asset Relief Program for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority tospur growth.Throughout the year we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney Rush LimbaughCongressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP) John Boehner (for seeking the speakership â€” or was it somethingabout an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases perhaps but not worth the timeof a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and histop advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money launderedthrough the CHamber of Commerce combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negativetelevision commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched but it also distracts from the issues voters careabout frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat storyline). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending the auto-company rescuethe health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold the foundation for abetter economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he saidFriday ""the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is 'You're hired"" and that's still notoccurring for too many Americans.The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections everything changes inJanuary. Republicans will have a greater obligation politically and morally to help govern rather than thwart and badger.The President will get a chance in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal to show he is turning thepage on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then Republicans are almost certainly goingto demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing especially when Americans seem to think that the ObamaAdministration hasn't much to offer either except more of the same that isn't working.â€¢ Find this article at:â€¢ http://www.time.com/time/golitics/article/08599202471800.htmlCopyright Â© 2010 Time Inc.

"<BR><BR>--<BR>Dear Beloved in Christ,<BR><BR>Please bear with me for sendingyou this just in case you are offended by it as I know we don\'t know eachother.It\'s my belief that I am doing the lord\'s bidding and what is trulyright in his eyes and that is what gives me the courage to send this emailto a total stranger like you. Before I start, I will need to warn you thatthis email might contain the most shocking and unbelievable piece of newsyou have ever had in your entire life, but I trust the lord to give youenough faith and insight to see the sincerity in my heart.<BR><BR><BR>It isby the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth; I had nochoice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for eternallife and in the sight of man for witness of God &amp; His Mercies and gloryupon my life.<BR><BR><BR>I am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. RobertWhite, my husband was an expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenyafor twenty years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for tenyears without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted foronly four days. Before his death we both got born-again and dedicatedChristians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outsidemy matrimonial home which the Bible is strongly against. When my latehusband was alive he deposited the sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million FiveHundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in a 4 year one-time fixed deposit accountwith a Bank in Europe . Presently, this money(with accrued interest) isstill with the Bank and the management just wrote me as the next ofKin/beneficiary to the account that it has become DORMANT since notransaction has been operated on it since the completion of the 4 years andif I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not re-activate the account; thefunds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a letter of authorization tosomebody to receive it on my behalf because of my condition(note that youneed to activate this account) as I can not come over. Presently, I\'m in ahospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I will die closer to natureand the lord) where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I haveonly a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributedto charity organizations anywhere in the World that might be in need of it.I have already donated most of our wealth here in Kenya to our local churchand our house after my death to an orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are alltotalling almost 800,000 USD. Because relatives and friends have plunderedso much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony ofentrusting futher this responsibility to any one of them any more.<BR><BR><BR>I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to thegood lord or you are not even a christian but today, this moment as you readthis, open your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in yourlife. Why would a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling youthis and be offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NOIDEA except, that I know that the lord\'s way are not our ways. I have cometo conclude that\'s it\'s divine. Who are we to question him anyway as justby his breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see thebeauty of his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it willbecome very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the sametime you are chosen for this, you other than someone else. It\'s all part ofthe big picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers willspend forever............<BR><BR><BR>Please, I beg you in the name of God tohelp me Stand-in as the beneficiary and collect the Funds from the Bank. Iwant a person that is God-fearing who will use this money to fund churches,orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that thehouse of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed isthe hand that giveth. I took this decision because I donï¿½t have any childthat will inherit this money and my husbandsï¿½ relatives are not Christiansand I donï¿½t want my husbandsï¿½ hard earned money to be misused byunbelievers. I donï¿½t want a situation where this money will be used in anungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am notafraid of death since I know where I am going to. I know that I am going tobe in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14} says that the lord will fightmy case and I shall hold my peace. I will not communicate with you by phonein this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husbandsï¿½relatives around me always. I donï¿½t want them to know about this developmentas I know all they are interested in is my husband\'s wealth and not myhealth.<BR><BR><BR>With God all things are possible. <BR><BR>Your Sister inChrist,<BR>Mrs. SandraWhite.<BR>sandrawhite1950@excite.com<BR>sandrawhite1950@yahoo.co.uk<BR><BR><BR><BR/><BR />________________________________________________<BR />Message sent using Postan 1.0<BR />",1

"Dear Friend,I feel quite safe dealing with you in this business proposition though, thismedium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest, surest and most secured medium of communication.I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before.My name is Mr ADAMS IBRAHIM  I am the bill and exchange manager in AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK [A.D.B) I Hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust and  confident that i am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on  6th of augustus 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.listSince the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$8.3M (Eight Million Three Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very longtime.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again.The Banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund after thisperiod.In view of this I got your contact through the internet when i was making a research on a foreignerthat I will use in this great  opportunity because i dont want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as uncliamed fund.I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for me.The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and  it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank for a citizen of BURKINA FASO to make the claim of the fund.So the request of you as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the claim and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the Next Of Kin to the deceased.If you are really sure of your integerity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.Upon receipt of the above mentioned informations,indicating your interest in the business,I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which you will type  and send back to our bank to enable us start this transaction.I will  not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free on both sides and dont have any negative impact.You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for  the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has been finalized, this  transaction will be completed within 10 bank workingday immediately you applied to the Bank as relation to the deceasedcustomer.Waiting for your urgent response           Yours sincerely,          Mr ADAMS IBRAHIM_________________________________________________________________Dï¿½couvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! www.windowslivemessenger.fr",1

"Dear Friend ,Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not =met,permit me however, I am MR.HASSAN  GEORGE,a Zimbabwean Farmer. I am =contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country =has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private =company in that region, as the present political instability in my country =(Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not =conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed,just as =reported by the International media.I wouldn't go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this web-site if =you have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.http://www.rte.ieews/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership =of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more =than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have =been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these =periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 =white farmers were killed, the government didn't stop at this, as just =recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms =to black farmers or risk going to prison.Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no =other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. =Therefore, I decided to contact you for your assistance so that I can =establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must =re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the =owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your =country.I have deposited in a Security company all the funds realised from the sales =of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to =USD8.5,000,000.00 (Eight million five hundred thousand United States =Dollars). These  funds was packaged in two trunk boxes and declared as =Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company and not to know =of the exact  content so that they don't steal my money.It is to the =knowledge of you and i that it is money that is in the trunk boxes.The trunk =boxes of us$8.5m have been arranged and securely sealed, crated and then =deposited with a security company ready for shipment abroad via diplomatic =courier service so as to make it immune to custom and other bureaucratic =checks at the ports. The reason for this is because it is the only way the funds can be =transferred without any problems.For now, I stay in U A E because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my =family. You can mail your immediate response to me. Upon your immediate =response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation =that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the =security company. Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% =risk free and shouldalso be handled in the most confidential manner.I have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage =of the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper =profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever option you =choose, feel free to notify me. If for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you =25% of the money while the  remaining 75% that is meant for me, will be for =the investment in your country.So based on the above, it is important you communicatewith me. On the event =that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep my =contact andexistence of my fund a secret. I also require you to make available to me the following 1)Your Complete name. 2)Your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me comminicate with =you easily.

"<P>PLEASE HELP ME <BR>Dear Friend, </P><P>You may be surprised to receive this letter, I got your contact through a desperate and personal search on the web for someone I could really trust as I have prayed over it and I wish to express my interest to handle this matter with you. </P><P><BR>Let me introduce myself to you before I go further; I am Mr. mark Abdul the son of late Mr. Abdul Kosoko who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I wouldn't go much deep detailing the problem I am having in my own country Zimbabwe, but you can have a look on This web-site;http://www.rte.ieews/2000/0418/zimbabwe. html, if you have the time you will understand the kind of brutal president we have.<BR>&nbsp;</P><P>Before the sudden death of my father, he foresees the looming danger in Zimbabwe and decided to make a deposit SUM OF$30 MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(THIRTY MILLION US DOLLARS)in disguise as consignment in a box with a Security Company in European&nbsp; . And he was forced to disclose this to me alone as his first son. And with faith, I am going to disclose the details to you,&nbsp; hoping that you will understand me and keep the secret to yourself, and most importantly to stand as the beneficiary to this fund, so that non of my country people we have any reason to track this money back. </P><P><BR>This money was deposited as family valuables due to the heat of the problem in Zimbabwe , so that the government will not try to confiscate the money if discovered. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in Swaziland . The land disputes started when Zimbabwean President ""MR. ROBERT MUGABE"" introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to many killings by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my Father was one of the victims. And because of this development I flew to Dubai to stay as a refugee. </P><P><BR>From the studies I have been able to make in Dubai concerning the right of a refugee, a lot of question will arise if I make any attempt to claim this fund directly concerning my age. And for the fact that I will not like to stay permanently in Dubai due to there law of not issuing permanent resident to foreigners. I am looking forward to stay in a country that the law will give me full right with time. And to have a good guardian that is knowledgeable in business and investment. It is just on this background that I have contacted you.</P><P><BR>Please, I need your assistance to transfer this fund to your trusted overseas bank account as soon as it is being claim from the Security Company. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total sum, while 10% is mapped out to re-in-burse all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and 60% will be for me and my family investment in your country under your kind control. </P><P><BR>Note that this transaction is 100% clear and risk-free, as I have made every necessary arrangement for a successful deal base on the little advice my let father gave to me. The only thing am soliciting from you is the total assistance to make a claim of the fund on your name from the Security Company, and after which the money will be paid into your account in your country </P><P><BR>I need your complete trust and assurance that my own part of money will be safe when transferred to your account. Kindly keep this business proposal highly confidential for security reasons. If you are interested in assisting me, Reply via the above email address and include your private phone and fax numbers. I will respond to you immediately. <BR>Looking forward to your urgent reply, God Bless. </P><P>Sincerely Yours, <BR>Mr. mark Abdul </P><P>&nbsp;</P><br><br><br><b>Ahora tambi&eacute;n puedes acceder a tu correo Terra desde el m&oacute;vil.</b><br><b>Inf&oacute;rmate pinchando</b><a href=""http://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;77451406;6134080;d?http://www.correo.movistar.es/do/isp/assistant/login?isp=terra""><b><strong> aqu&iacute;.</strong></b></a><br>------=_Part_11732_18401494.1173798738823--",1

"HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONK KONG.Dear Sir, Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.  So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years and 10 months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Wang  Qin",1

"Dear FriendCompliments of the seasonsThis letter is written to you based on contact information I came across on web while searching for investment options overseas. My name is *Tony Silver and I work as a manager in an Insurance company here.I discovered one unclaimed policy for the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars {US$12,000,000.00} to be paid out as SURRENDER VALUE for the LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY of one liquidated oil servicing company by name {CEDRY INCORPORATED} that went bankrupt nine years ago and does not exist anymore.For us to claim this money, we need a foreigner who will stand as the manager ofthe liquidated company to file a claim on this policy using details and information I will supply.I have made efforts over the years to get any foreign member of the liquidated company without success. I finally found a lawyer by name BARRISTER PRINCE VICTOR who was the lawyer/attorney of the liquidated company. I revealed the unclaimed policy to him and he has accepted to work with me to get the Surrender value paid to the account of any foreigner I will provide to stand as the manager of the liquidated company. Barrister Victor told me that the manager then was very sick during their companyï¿½s liquidation and later died and for that reason no one raised the issue of their Surrender value with our insurance company.If you accept to stand as the manager or an Assistant manager of the liquidated Company to claim this surrender value of Twelve million dollars, I am willing to split the funds into three parts, for each of us having an equal share of Four Million Dollar. Once you file the claim, we will do the rest for you in the inside and get the payment released in your name. If you are interested and capable please get back to me through email.I will send my identifications to you once you indicate your interest to work with me. There is no risky in your involved because the company has been liquidated and dissolved and has left Africa for about eight years.This Barrister Victor and I will come over to your country for our share once this transaction is concluded. I am optimistic that we will conclude this transaction within three weeks.Thanks in advance for your anticipated co-operationRegardsMr.Tony Silver",1

"Dear friend,This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal soliciting for your unreserved assistance in consummating an urgent transaction.By way of summarized profile of myself, I am Senator Luisa Pimentel Estrada, a 74years old lady and the first wife of Joseph Ejercito Estrada (former head of state and President of Philippines) who is presently held in detention in a hospital outside manilla,Philippines.However, the current administration of Gloria Arroyo(The President of Philippines) the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of Joseph Ejercito Estrada including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my Husband in Switzerland,UK and Australia. We cannot be held responsible for the sins of my Husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save our family from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we shall discuss the disbursement ratio in our next correspondence after we have been acquainted. In fact, the attack on our family (The Estrada's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our traveling passport, family accounts, trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my Husband and even restrict us from seeing my husband.Ihave carefully moved out these funds (US$18 million), before my husband was impeached to an offshore Deposit Company.From past experiences, many people I had regarded as close friends has capitalize on my family's travail to run away with my money. In order to avert this negative development, I in conjunction with my son (DANIEL) now seek your permission to allow my attorney do a CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP/REASSIGNMENT OF CREDIT of stated funds from the deposit company to your name, so that the funds (US$18million) would be released to you as the new owner (on behalf of me and my family).In view of this grievous threat to our Economic and personal survival, our family trustee have secretly protected the deposit, you are to assist us to lay claims of the consignment with the aid of all legal documents that will be forwarded to you as time goes on.I am writing because when I deposited the money in the deposit company, I told them that it belonged to a foreign business partner and my present position will not allow me to claim the funds. Consequently, I will present you as the owner of the funds in the Deposit Company so you can be able to claim them. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately;1. Full names2. Contact address3. Telephone and fax numbersOnce I receive this information, we will prepare the necessary documents that will put you in place as the new owner of the funds. The money will then be released to your custody by the Deposit Company, for us to share. No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive,please we employ you to observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because we shall require your assistance to invest our share in your country (buying of properties like houses, hotels etc). This is why your urgent action and response is of priority to enable us concluding this transaction in a timely and professional manner.Awaiting your swift response via this email address:lp4estrada@yahoo.co.in indicating your interest pls.Thanks and regards,Luisa Pimentel Estrada.",1

Though I amvery rich, I was never generous, I was always hostileto people and only focused on my business as that wasthe only thing I cared for. But now I regret all thisas I now know that there is more to life than justwanting to have or make all the money in the world.Ibelieve when God gives me a second chance to come tothis world I would live my life a different way fromhow I have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and givenmost of my property and assets to my immediate andextended familymembers as well as a few closefriends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept mysoul so, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth.So far, I have distributed money to some charityorganizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannotdo this myself anymore. I once asked members of myfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute themoney which I have there to charity organization inBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the moneyto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, asthey seem not to be contended with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I havewith a finance/Security Company abroad.

"Dear Friend, SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in soinformal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgentneed to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreignpartner. This request may seem strange andunsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and praythat you view it seriously. My name is MR Williams Daniel of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of theclose aides to the former President of the DemocraticRepublic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessedmemory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA toforce out the rebels in my country, I and some of mycolleagues were instructed by Late President Kabilato  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth ofTwenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United StatesDollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebelgroup. But when President Kabila was killed in abloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before wewere schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to divert the fund into a private securitycompany here in Congo for safe keeping. The securityof the said amount is presently being threatened herefollowing the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel fromour same tribe, by the new President of the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, the son of late President LaurentKabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthyforeign partner who can assist us to move this moneyout of my country as the beneficiary.WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund underDiplomatic Cover to a security company in the europein your name. This is to ensure that the DiplomaticBaggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will notpass through normal custom/airport screening andclearance.Our inability to move this money out of Congo allThis while lies on our lack of trust on our supposedgood friends (western countries) who suddenly becamehostile to those of us who worked with the latePresident Kabila, immediately after his son tookoffice. Though we have neither seen nor met eachother, the information We gathered from an associatewho has worked in your country has encouraged andconvinced us that with your sincere assistance, thistransaction will be properly handled with modestyand honesty to a huge success within two weeks. Thesaid money is a state fund and therefore requires atotal confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fundout of Congo, you can contact me through my emailaddress above with your telephone, fax number andpersonal information to enable us discuss themodalities and what will be your share(percentage) for assisting us.I must use this opportunity and medium to implore Youto exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matterextraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,while I await your prompt response.

"Dearest one,I am Mrs Mariam Afonso I was married to Mr. Moses Afonsowho was a contractor with the government of Cote D'Ivoire before he died in the year 2002 after few days in the hospital. The doctor said his death was as a result of poison.We were married for so many years without a child.Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $25 Million usa dollars with a security company here in Cote D lvoire Presently this money is still in the custody of the security company in Cote D lvoire. Recently, my Doctor told me that it is very likely i will die within the next nine months due to cancer problem.Having known my condition I decided to donatethis fund to a church,organization or good person that will utilize  this money the way I am going to instruct herein.I want a church,organization or good person that will use this fund for orphanages, widows and other people that need help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that""Blessed is the hand that giveth"". l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband's property and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.I don't want them to know about this development and l know that With God all things are possible This is why I am taking this decision.Though it was very painful to hear this kind of news from my doctor but I am notafraid of death because I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. I don't think there is need for any telephone communication in this regard because of my health but the important thing to me is for you to do what i will require you in this regard.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security company here in Cote d' lvoire. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the Security company  that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money.Note when you will contact the security company on no account should you let them know that the content of the deposit is money because my late husband decleared it to them as containg family values belonging to his foriegn business partner who will come for the withdrawal and termination of the contract with the certificate of the deposit which was issued to my late husband by the security company on the day he made the deposit with them which i will send to you on your confirmation that you can handle this transaction.I also want you,church or the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my only shepherd.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spiritand Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Anydelay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person, church,organization for this same purpose.Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your response immedaitely through my private email account(mariamafo@netscape.net).Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.l remain yours sister in Christ.Mrs. Mariam Afonso",1

"FROM:DR IBRAHIM BELLOAUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNITBANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASOWEST AFRICA.PHONE:00226-76-441-987Attention Please,                                                      (TOP  --  SECRET)I am Dr Ibrahim  Bello , the director in charge of auditing and accounting sectionBank Of Africa(B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa.With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial for both of us at the end of it.During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on October 31st 2002 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relatives before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S $22.2M (twenty two million two hundred thousand United States dollars).As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through the Burkina-faso cHamber of foreign relations here in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso.Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(As a Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me . Please, you have been adviced to keep ""TOP-SECRET"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal .I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and  further  investment, either in your country or any country you advice me  to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.if you are really sure of your integrity reply me immediately or you call me on my mobile phone .Yours faithfully,Dr Ibrahim Bello.00226-76-441-987._________________________________________________________________Don't just search.

"Dear Friend!   It is with heart of hope that I write to seek your help in the context below. My name is Zuma Seko,an origin of Liberia but reside in Europe. I gotyour contact during a business search into the Internet and was inspired to seek your co-operation.  Based on trust and because I reside in Europe, my father in-law, Mr. Peter Chingoka, gave me a mandate to source for viable business ventures where he can invest funds of approximately USD18.4M. He was a member of the tournament policy committee responsible for planning the ICC CRICKET WORLD CUP, which took place in South Africa from 8th Feb. -23rd march 2003.  In the course of carrying out his duties as the chairman of the above committee, he over-inflated the contract sum to the tune of USD$18.4 Million. He initially kept this money in a safe deposit Bureau in Zimbabwe under a personal identification number (PIN) to eradicate trace of the deposit to him. Under the administration of President Robert Mugabe, civil servants such as my in-law are not in any position to amass such amount of money. To eliminate this, the democratic government set up a panel of inquiry to probe the financial activities of any government official that is suspected for misappropriation of funds and the mandated decision to seize all his assets and face a twenty-one years jail term. Based on this law and to avoid complications, the funds were later moved through the help of his proxy at the deposit bureau to their affiliate in Europe where it is kept as a deposit.  By virtue of his job as a civil servant, he is poorly paid and cannot defend the source of the funds if caught. To avoid such, he prefers to be anonymous during the execution of this project. This is why I am representing him. Please, treat this letter as confidential as possible. I have made all necessary enquiries to conclude the transaction but I do not have the credibility as a foreigner to realize it. It is on this premise that your assistance is required, to claim and invest the funds in a joint venture partnership business on behalf of my in-law.  My in-law has agreed to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the funds when finally received in your local bank account, 5% for any expenses incurred and invest the outstanding into a joint venture business partnership that would be under your direct management. I have completed the legal framework required to appoint you as a Trustee to my In-law, so that you can claim and invest the funds on his behalf.  I look forward to your response.

"                           STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIALYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't knowme personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVIDKUBA,the first SON of MR.PEDRO KUBA,a farmer and leader movement forDemocratic change  (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land disputein Zimbabwe.I was furnished with viable information from the International TradeCentre here in Johannesburg and I decided to  write to you. Before thedeath of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum ofUS$40 M(FOURTY  MILLION  UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, asif he fore saw the  looming danger in Zimbabwe.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals  forthe farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This landproblem  came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a newLand Act which  wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blackfarmers.This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean warveterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact, alot of people have been killed because of this land reformed Actfor which my father was one of the victims.It is against this  background, that I and my family who are currentlystaying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's  money to foreignaccount since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker)to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction.As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility ofseeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferredwithout the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everythingwe have got.I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money  in South Africa  for fear of going through the same experience  in future since bothcountries have similar political history. Moreover,the South  AfricanForeign Exchange policy  does  not allow such investment as an  asylumseeker. As a business man,whom I have entrusted my future and of my familyin his hands,I must let  you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring themoney into any account you will nominate overseas.This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you,firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money fornominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go intopartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money inyour country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurredin the proccess of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of themoney while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with the above telephone number while I implore you to maintainthe absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the levelof transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending areply.Please, You should keep this transaction secret and confidential. And sendyour fax and telephone numbers for easy communication.N/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following:1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.2) YOUR FULL NAME.3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.THANKS FOR YOUR CO-OPERATIONDAVID KUBA (FOR THE FAMILY)",1

"Dear Friend,First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. However after series of petition was recieved by this present regime from foreign contractors and inability of the BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its foreign creditors, in conjunction with the council of ministers, they mandated us to carry out a careful and comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign contractors and to effect payments immediately.During the above mentioned process, we discovered an abandoned sum of US$10.M (Ten million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with hisentire famil in a plane crash that happened in Kenya, East Africa.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.Please I want you to visit the website below for more information about the Plane Crash:www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.htmlIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety andsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,and 50% would be for me, while 10% will be for expenses incure during the transaction. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the application to fill and send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free risk and this transaction will only take us14 banking days because as a banker, I know what to do and move the fund into your account without any delay and thatyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement have been made for the transfer.You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter so that I will send you the text of the application to apply to the bank.Yours faithfully.MR ISIAKA AKIDABill & Exchange Manager,BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)------------------------------------------Faites un voeu et puis Voila ! www.voila.fr ",1

Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama inany event is the important person in this story because he is the one who decides.""etanyahu to meet Obama but not ClintonEli Bardenstein Maariv July 1 2010 [page 7; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]rime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington where he will meetwith US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of StateHillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.Contrary to his previous visit in March this time the US administration intends to create the impressionoutwardly at least that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between thetwo countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression the two leaders will meet the mediatogether and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time Netanyahu will also be put up at BlairHouse the official White House guesthouse and not at a hotel.That said officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide inthe course of the meeting which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at animpasse to direct negotiations. Obama apparently will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend theconstruction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PAChairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel. For the time being the forum of seven isdivided over this issue.Read more of this post",0

This is the most definitive objective analysisso far. Sidhttp://www.chatHamhouse.org.uk/files/14234_iranelection0609.pdfThis paper is published by ChatHam House andthe Institute of Iranian Studies University of StAndrewsPreliminary Analysis of the VotingFigures in Iran's 2009 PresidentialElectionEditor:Professor Ali Ansari Director Institute of Iranian StudiesUniversity of St Andrews; Associate Fellow Middle East andNorth Africa Programme ChatHam House; author 'IranIslam and Democracy'Research and Analysis:Daniel Berman and Thomas Rintoul Institute of IranianStudies University of St Andrews21 June 2009ChatHam House is independent and owes no allegiance to government orto any political body. It does not hold opinions of its own; the viewsexpressed in this text are the responsibility of the authors. Thisdocument is issued on the understanding that if any extract is used theauthors and ChatHam House should be credited preferably with the dateof the publication.Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 2Executive SummaryWorking from the province by province breakdowns of the 2009 and 2005results released by the Iranian Ministry of Interior and from the 2006 censusas published by the official Statistical Centre of Iran the following observationsabout the official data and the debates surrounding it can be made.â€¢In two conservative provinces Mazandaran and Yazd a turnout ofmore than 100% was recorded.â€¢At a provincial level there is no correlation between the increasedturnout and the swing to Ahmadinejad. This challenges the notion thatAhmadinejad's victory was due to the massive participation of apreviously silent conservative majority.â€¢In a third of all provinces the official results would require thatAhmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters all formercentrist voters and all new voters but also up to 44% of formerReformist voters despite a decade of conflict between these twogroups.â€¢In 2005 as in 2001 and 1997 conservative candidates andAhmadinejad in particular were markedly unpopular in rural areas.That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth. The claimthat this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provincesflies in the face of these trends.Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 31. Irregularities in Voter TurnoutTwo provinces show a turnout of over 100% and four more show a turnout ofover 90%. Regional variations in participation have disappeared. There is nocorrelation between the increase in participation and the swing toAhm adinejad.Firstly across the board there is a massive increase in turnout with severalprovinces increasing their participation rate by nearly 75%. This increaseresults in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces with thestandard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over 23% since2005. The 2005 results show a substantial turnout gap with seven provincesrecording turnout below 60% and ten above 70%. In 2009 only two werebelow 70% and 24 were above 80%. In fact 21 out of 30 provinces hadturnouts within 5% of 83%. The data seems to suggest that regional variationsin participation have suddenly disappeared.This makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provincesthat saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad(Fig.1) all the more unusual. There is no significant correlation between theincrease in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad(Fig.1). This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase inparticipation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election forAhmadinejad somewhat problematic.Furthermore there are concerns about the numbers themselves. Twoprovinces Mazandaran and Yazd have results which indicate that more voteswere cast on 12 June than there were eligible voters and that four moreprovinces had turnouts in the mid-nineties.In a country where allegations of 'tombstone voting' â€” the practice200f using theidentity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots â€” are both longstandingand widespread this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected.This problem did not start with Ahmadinejad; according to official statisticsgathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistancein Stockholm there were 12.9% more registered voters at the time ofMoHammed Khatami's 2001 victory than there were citizens of voting age.In conclusion a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures areproblematic. The massive increases from 2005 the collapse of regionalvariations and the absence of any clear correlation between increases inturnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the resultsproblematic.Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 4Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 (See appendix)Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 52. Where did Ahmadinejad's New Votes Come From?According to the official Ministry of Interior voting data (see Appendix)Mahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by 113%compared to the 2005 election. There is little correlation in provincial levelresults between the increase in turnout and the swing to the Presidentchallenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has comeout to support him. Interestingly in 1.0 out of 30 provinces mainly formerMehdi Karrubi strongholds the official data suggests that Ahmadinejadreceived not only the votes of all former non-voters and former Rafsanjanivoters but also took up to 44% of the vote from those who had previouslyvoted Reformist.According to the official data1 Mahmud Ahmadinejad has receivedapproximately 13m more votes in this election than the combined conservativevote in the 2005 Presidential election2.Assuming that Ahmadinejad retained all 11.5m Conservative votes from 2005these additional 13m votes could have come from three sources indescending order of likelihood:â€¢The approximately 10.6m citizens who did not vote in 2005 but choseto vote in this electionâ€¢The 6.2m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in 2005â€¢The 10.4m citizens who voted for Reformist candidates in 2005In order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejad's increased support camefrom the table below (Fig.3) shows the composition of the 2009 vote byprovince dividing it into those who voted Conservative Rafsanjani andReformist in 2005 and those who did not vote at all in 2005. It assumes that2005 voters will vote again.The table demonstrates that in the 10 of Iran's 30 provinces highlighted red inorder for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed towin over all new voters all former Rafsanjani voters and also up to 44% offormer reformist voters.1 Serious complaints have been raised about both the 2005 elections and the 2009elections. Government data is not perfectly reliable.2 In 2005 there were three Conservative candidates in the first round. Ahmadinejad canreasonably be expected to have received in 2009 all votes cast for Conservatives in2005. Here Ahmadinejad's 2009 performance is compared to the combinedperformance of all three Conservatives in 2005.Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 6It is notable that many of these are provinces where the Reformist cleric MehdiKarrubi polled highly in 2005 and the government's figures would appear tosuggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likelyReformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi as many had expected but ratherthat they have defected to the hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad.This interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between thepercentage of former Karrubi voters in a province and its swing toAhmadinejad (Fig.2).To many Reformists this situation is extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi is awell-known reformist of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues ofpolitical and cultural freedoms economic management and foreign policy.They allege fraud and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubi's vote hascollapsed will provide the bulk of the 600+ complaints which the defeatedc andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election.However Karrubi like Ahmadinejad is seen as a 'man of the people' andAhmadinejad is as much a re-incarnation of the Islamic Republic's early hardleft as he is a leader of its current hard-right. Ahmadinejad's supporters thusclaim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 for precisely the samereasons that they voted for Karrubi in 2005.The data offers no arbitration in this dispute although Roukema's applicationof statistical fraud detection techniques to the 'by district' data has turned upsome anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubi's vote3 which maysuggest that they were created by a computer. These can be followed upshould the fully disaggregated 'by polling station' data be released during theongoing dispute.3 B Roukena 'Benford's Law Anomalies in the 2009 Iranian Presidential Election' (asyet unpublished article 2009).Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 7Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 (See appendix)Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 8Potential sources of new votes for Ahmadinejad (Fig.3)ProvinceAhmadinejadVoters '09AhmadinejadVoters '05OtherConservativeVoters '05Non-Voters'05RafsanjaniVoters '05Reformist Voters '05Assumed Takeof FormerReformistVotersEastAzerbaijan1131111 198417 150235 684745 268954 690784 -24.79%WestAzerbaijan623946 75319 156724 520896 151525 409798 -68.45%Ardebil 325911 34090 114038 161510 95490 232505 -34.07%Isfahan 1799255 801635 271861 854867 260858 423098 -92.17%Ilam 199654 32383 47865 20165 40580 168179 34.88%Bushehr 299357 82376 55169 81202 97412 171637 -9.79%Tehran 3819495 1500829 860548 2424653 1274276 1345533 -166.54%Chaharmahal& Bakhtiari359578 90960 87195 126366 59521 128451 -3.48%SouthernKhorasan285984 101638 54759 95657 57244 71939 -32.41%RazaviKhorasan2214801 377732 956641 638925 527707 656736 -43.58%NorthernKhorasan341104 22954 116991 115487 70407 135090 11.30%Khuzestan 1303129 232874 206798 543802 319921 707428 -0.04%Zanjan 444480 93309 94234 132237 110698 150062 9.33%Semnan 295177 98024 65249 90128 69773 56344 -49.69%Sistan &Baluchistan450269 47743 93559 117432 155147 563454 6.46%Fars 1758026 242535 334925 738209 403074 786195 5.00%Qazvin 498061 118414 102048 188868 108928 168013 -12.02%Qom 422457 256110 36686 125178 104004 67557 -147.31%Kordestan 315689 22353 59174 251014 54004 211918 -33.44%Kerman 1160446 129284 333275 337502 480271 215357 -55.67%Kermanshah 573568 70117 137472 251113 137010 374100 -5.92%Kohgilouye &Boyerahmad253962 34396 72565 53615 56154 148985 24.99%Golestan 515211 56776 129856 156256 155498 358715 4.69%Gilan 998573 149026 221632465190 215478 420258 -12.55%Lorestan 677829 69710 101394 162848 121130 500859 44.47%Mazandaran 1289257 159291 581654 581269 311949 270104 -127.69%Markezi 572988 161669 89086 200024 143118 184172 -11.35%Hormozegan 482990 81054 103487 136459 75601 340740 25.35%Hamedan 765723 195030 96988 218400 175997 322938 24.56%Yazd 337178175206 76209 150781 77924 123828 -115.44%Totals 24515209 5711254 5808317 10624798 6179653 10404777Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 93. Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad?Many commentators have suggested before and after the PresidentialElection that Ahmadinejad is very popular in rural areas and that this explainshis high levels of support. However the data from the 2005 Presidentialelection does not support this contention. Instead it confirms that whatsupport Ahmadinejad did gain in 2005 was mainly from urban and suburbanareas. The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad againstthe rural population of the province in question (Fig.4) and Conservatives as agroup (Fig.5).Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chatHamhouse.org.uk 10Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 and Iranian Census of2006 (see appendix)This data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics4that rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supportersoccasionally described in western media. This is supported by the fact thatmuch of Iran's rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities: Lors Baluchâ€¢Kurdish and Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities have a history bothof voting Reformist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group. Forexample they were an important segment of Khatami's vote in 1997 and 2001and voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in 2005.The 2009 data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely theserural provinces which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any otherconservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At thesame time the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi who wasextremely popular in these rural ethnic minority areas in 2005 has collapsedentirely even in his home province of Lorestan where his vote has gone from440247 (55.5%) in 2005 to just 44036 (4.6%) in 2009. This is paralleled byan overall swing of 50.9% to Ahmadinejad with official results suggesting thathe has captured the support of 47.5% of those who cast their ballots for4 Cf.

This more than any other result is highlyimplausible and has been the subject of much debate in Iran.This increase in support for Ahmadinejad amongst rural and ethnic minoritiyvoters is out of step with previous trends extremely large in scale and centralto the question of why (or indeed whether) he won in June 2009.Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 and Iranian Census
